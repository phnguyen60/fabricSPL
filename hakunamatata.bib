abstract = {Stroke patients often have flexor hypertonia and finger extensor weakness, which makes it difficult to open their affected hand for functional grasp. Because of this impairment, hand rehabilitation after stroke is essential for restoring functional independent lifestyles. The goal of this study is to develop a passive, lightweight, wearable device to assist with hand function during performance of activities of daily living. The device, Hand Spring Operated Movement Enhancer (HandSOME), assists with opening the patient's hand using a series of elastic cords that apply extension torques to the finger joints and compensates for the flexor hypertonia. Device design and calibration are described as well as functional and usability testing with stroke subjects with a wide range of hand impairments. In initial testing with eight stroke subjects with finger flexor hypertonia, use of the HandSOME significantly increased range of motion and functional ability (p=0.002) . There was some decrease in grip strength with the HandSOME device at the subject's ideal setting, however this was not statistically significant (p=0.167) and did not seem to have a significant effect on function. Overall HandSOME shows promise as a training tool to facilitate repetitive task practice for improving hand function in stroke patients. HandSOME can be used as part of a home-based therapy program, or as an orthotic for replacing lost function.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of hand exoskeleton technologies for rehabilitation and assistive engineering, from basic hand biomechanics to actuator technologies. Because of rapid advances in mechanical designs and control algorithms for electro-mechanical systems, exoskeleton devices have been developed significantly, but are still limited to use in larger body areas such as upper and lower limbs. however, because of their requirements for smaller size and rich tactile sensing capabilities, hand exoskeletons still face many challenges in many technical areas, including hand biomechanics, neurophysiology, rehabilitation, actuators and sensors, physical human-robot interactions and ergonomics. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of active hand exoskeletons for applications in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive robotics. The main requirements of these hand exoskeleton devices are also identified and the mechanical designs of existing devices are classified. The challenges facing an active hand exoskeleton robot are also discussed.},

The exoskeleton has a three-finger design, the third and fourth fingers being combined to lighten and simplify the assembly. The motions of the hand are monitored by an array of pressure sensors mounted between the exoskeleton and the hand. Controller commands are determined by a state-of-the-art programmable microcontroller using pressure sensor input. These commands are applied to a PWM driven DC motor array which provides the motive power to move the exoskeleton fingers. The resultant motion of the exoskeleton allows the astronaut to perform both precision grasping tasks with the thumb and forefinger, as well as a power grasp with the entire hand},

Being able to measure and analyze that gait is often critical for rehabilitation. Motion analysis labs and many current methods of gait analysis are expensive and inaccessible to most individuals. The low-cost, wearable, and wireless insole-based gait analysis system in this study provides kinetic measurements of gait by using low-cost force sensitive resistors. This paper describes the design and fabrication of the insole and its evaluation in six control subjects and four hemiplegic stroke subjects. Subject-specific linear regression models were used to determine ground reaction force plus moments corresponding to ankle dorsiflexion / plantarflexion, knee flexion / extension, and knee abduction / adduction. Comparison with data simultaneously collected from a clinical motion analysis laboratory demonstrated that the insole results for ground reaction force and ankle moment were highly correlated (all {\textgreater} 0.95) for all subjects, while the two knee moments were less strongly correlated (generally {\textgreater} 0.80). This provides a means of cost-effective and efficient healthcare delivery of mobile gait analysis that can be used anywhere from large clinics to an individuals home.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a novel soft cable-driven exosuit that can apply forces to the body to assist walking. Unlike traditional exoskeletons which contain rigid framing elements, the soft exosuit is worn like clothing, yet can generate moments at the ankle and hip with magnitudes of 18{\%} and 30{\%} of those naturally generated by the body during walking, respectively. Our design uses geared motors to pull on Bowden cables connected to the suit near the ankle. The suit has the advantages over a traditional exoskeleton in that the wearer's joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light, which minimizes the suit's unintentional interference with the body's natural biomechanics. However, a soft suit presents challenges related to actuation force transfer and control, since the body is compliant and cannot support large pressures comfortably. We discuss the design of the suit and actuation system, including principles by which soft suits can transfer force to the body effectively and the biological inspiration for the design. For a soft exosuit, an important design parameter is the combined effective stiffness of the suit and its interface to the wearer.

The impetus behind the Robotarium is that multi-robot testbeds constitute an integral and essential part of the multi-robot research cycle, yet they are expensive, complex, and time-consuming to develop, operate, and maintain. These resource constraints, in turn, limit access for large groups of researchers and students, which is what the Robotarium is remedying by providing users with remote access to a state-of-the-art multi-robot test facility. This paper details the design and operation of the Robotarium and discusses the considerations one must take when making complex hardware remotely accessible. In particular, safety must be built into the system already at the design phase without overly constraining what coordinated control programs users can upload and execute, which calls for minimally invasive safety routines with provable performance guarantees.},

abstract = {The field of robotic surgery increasingly advances towards highly articulated and continuum robots, requiring new kinematic strategies to enable users to perform dexterous manipulation in confined workspaces. This development is driven by surgical interventions accessing the surgical workspace through natural orifices such as the mouth or the anus. Due to the long and narrow nature of these access pathways, external triangulation at the fulcrum point is very limited or absent, which makes introducing multiple degrees of freedom at the distal end of the instrument necessary. Additionally, high force and miniaturization requirements make the control of such instruments particularly challenging. This paper presents the kinematic considerations needed to effectively manipulate these novel instruments and allow their dexterous control in confined spaces. A non-linear calibration model is further used to map joint to actuator space and improve significantly the precision of the instrument's motion. The effectiveness of the presented approach is quantified with bench tests, and the usability of the system is assessed by three user studies simulating the requirements of a realistic surgical task.},

abstract = {Purpose – Describes a dual-arm mobile manipulator that can autonomously scan natural terrain using a typical handheld landmine detector in a manner similar to a human operator. Design/methodology/approach – Presents a terrain-scanning robot that consists of two articulated arms mounted on an off-road remotely operated vehicle. One arm carries a laser and four ultrasonic rangefinders to build a terrain map. The map is used in real time to generate an obstacle-free path for the second arm that manipulates the landmine detector autonomously. The arms are mounted on the vehicle that is controlled by an operator from a safe distance. Motion planning and control of the robot is carried out using an embedded computer that is linked to a host computer to transmit the detector data and operator commands. Findings – Finds that the terrain-scanning robot can effectively manipulate a relatively large landmine detector on rugged terrain with undulations and obstacles. Research limitations/implications – Proposes real-time motion planning that may be equally applicable to other mobile manipulators. Practical implications – Provides a technology that together with state-of-the-art landmine sensors will offer a safe solution for detecting hidden landmines and clearing them from the postwar countries. Originality/value – Introduces the concept of a dual-arm mobile terrain scanning robot for landmine detection in off-road missions and civilian areas where truck-mounted detectors are inefficient.},

abstract = {Infertility affects 50 to 80 million people worldwide. Male factor is a cause of infertility in almost half of cases, mainly due to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). With common diagnostic methods no cause can be found in approximately 30{\%} of cases of male infertility due to OAT and these are considered idiopathic. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in male infertility and are proved to be higher in infertile men; antioxidants could oppose their effect. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on clinical trials in the period from year 2000 to year 2013 studying the effects of various types of antioxidant supplements on basic and other sperm parameters and pregnancy rates in subfertile males with idiopathic OAT. The majority of studies were randomized and placebo controlled and confirmed beneficial effect of antioxidants on at least one of the semen parameters; the biggest effect was determined on sperm motility. In many of these trials combinations of more antioxidants were assessed. The optimal dosages of one or more antioxidants were not defined. We concluded that antioxidants play an important role in protecting semen from ROS and can improve basic sperm parameters in case of idiopathic OAT.},

abstract = {Metabolic studies have shown that there is a metabolic cost associated with carrying load (T. M. Griffen, et al., 2003). In previous work, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton has been described that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload (C. J. Walsh, et al., 2006). A state-machine control strategy is written based on joint angle and ground-exoskeleton force sensing to control the joint actuation at this exoskeleton hip and knee. The joint components of the exoskeleton in the sagittal plane consist of a force-controllable actuator at the hip, a variable-damper mechanism at the knee and a passive spring at the ankle. The control is motivated by examining human walking data. Positive, non-conservative power is added at the hip during the walking cycle to help propel the mass of the human and payload forward. At the knee, the damper mechanism is turned on at heel strike as the exoskeleton leg is loaded and turned off during terminal stance to allow knee flexion. The passive spring at the ankle engages in controlled dorsiflexion to store energy that is later released to assist in powered plantarflexion. Preliminary studies show that the state machines for the hip and knee work robustly and that the onset of walking can be detected in less than one gait cycle. Further, it is found that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle},

abstract = {—Retroflexion during colonoscopy is typically only practiced in the wider proximal and distal ends of the large in-testine owing to the stiff nature of the colonoscope. This inability to examine the proximal side of the majority of colon folds contributes to today's suboptimal colorectal cancer detection rates. We have developed an algorithm for autonomous retroflexion of a flexible endoscope that is actuated magnetically from the tip. The magnetic wrench applied on the tip of the endoscope is optimized in real time with data from pose detection to compute motions of the actuat-ing magnet. This is the first example of a completely autonomous maneuver by a magnetic endoscope for exploration of the gastroin-testinal tract. The proposed approach was validated in plastic tubes of various diameters with a success rate of 98.8{\%} for separation distances up to 50 mm. Additionally, a set of trials was conducted in an excised porcine colon observing a success rate of 100{\%} with a mean time of 19.7 s. In terms of clinical safety, the maximum stress that is applied on the colon wall with our methodology is an order of magnitude below what would damage tissue.

abstract = {Teleoperated robotic surgery allows filtering and scaling the hand motion to achieve high precision during the surgical interventions. Teleoperation represents a very complex sensory-motor task, mainly due to the kinematic and kinetic redundancies that characterize the human motor control. It requires an intensive training phase to acquire sufficient familiarity with the master-slave architecture. We estimated the hand stiffness modulation during the execution of a simulated suturing task in teleoperation, with two different master devices, and in free-hand. Kinematic data of eight right-handed users were acquired, using electromagnetic and optical tracking systems, and analysed using a musculoskeletal model. Through inverse dynamics, muscular activation was computed and used to obtain the joint torque and stiffness, leading to end-point stiffness estimation. The maximal stiffness value and its angular displacement with respect to the trajectory tangent was computed. The results show that there is a difference in how the main stiffness axis was modulated by using the two master devices with respect to free-hand, with higher values and variability for the serial link manipulator. Moreover, a directional modulation of the hand stiffness through the trajectory was found, showing that the users were aligning the direction of the main stiffness axis perpendicularly to the trajectory.},

Considering that an intelligent agent attends to a task-specific object target during execution, our goal is to detect the object efficiently. We propose the concept of early recognition, which influences the candidate proposal process to achieve fast and reliable detection performance. To check the target constraints efficiently, we put forward a novel policy to generate a sub-optimal checking order, and prove that it has bounded time cost compared to the optimal checking sequence, which is not achievable in polynomial time. Experiments on two different scenarios: 1) rigid object and 2) non-rigid body part detection validate our pipeline. To show that our method is widely applicable, we further present a human-robot interaction system based on our non-rigid body part detection.},

abstract = {Traversing environments with arbitrary obstacles poses significant challenges for bipedal robots. In some cases, whole body motions may be necessary to maneuver around an obstacle, but most existing footstep planners can only select from a discrete set of predetermined footstep actions, they are unable to utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the robot platform. Existing motion planners that can utilize whole body motion tend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a planning method, called the "Randomized Possibility Graph", which uses high-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the "possibility" of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be utilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in a variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context, "semi-unstructured" means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are arbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped over or maneuvered around using whole body motions.},

abstract = {In recent years soft wearable exoskeletons, com- monly referred to as exosuits, have been widely exploited in human assistance. Hence a shared approach for a systematic and exhaustive control architecture is extremely important. Most of the exosuits developed so far employ a bowden cable trans- mission to conveniently place the actuator away from the end- effector. Whilst having many advantages this actuation strategy presents some intrinsic limitations caused by the presence of nonlinearities, such as friction and backlash of the cables, which make it difficult to predict and control the dynamics between the device and the user. In the present paper, we propose a novel hierarchical control paradigm for a cable-driven upper limb exosuits that aims at evaluating and consequently deliver the appropriate assistive torque to the user's elbow joint. The proposed control method comprises three main layers: an active impedance control which estimates the user's arm motion intention and guarantees an intuitive response of the suit to the wearer's motion; a mid-level controller which compensates for the backlash in the transmission and converts the reference arm motion to the desired position of the actuator; a low-level controller which is responsible for driving the actuation stage by compensating for the non linear dynamics occurring in the bowden cable to provide the desired assistive torque at the joint. Tests on healthy subjects show that wearing the exosuit reduces by 48.3{\%} the muscular effort required to lift 1kg and that the controller is able to modulate its level of assistance to the wearer's motor ability.

abstract = {? 2015 IEEE.Continuum robots, which have continuous mechanical structures comparable to the flexibility in elephant trunks and octopus arms, have been primarily geared toward the medical and defense communities. In space, however, NASA projects these robots to have a place in irregular inspection routines. The inherent compliance and bending of these continuum arms are especially suitable for inspection in obstructed spaces to ensure proper equipment functionality. In this paper, we propose a new solution that improves on the functionality of previous continuum robots, via a novel mechanical scaly layer-jamming design. Layer-jamming assisted continuum arms have previously required pneumatic sources for actuation, which limit their portability and usage in aerospace applications. This paper combines the compliance of continuum arms and stiffness modulation of the layer jamming mechanism to design a new hybrid layer jamming continuum arm. The novel design uses an electromechanical actuation which eliminates the pneumatic actuation therefore making it compact and portable.},

abstract = {An accurate and reliable image based fruit detection system is critical for supporting higher level agriculture tasks such as yield mapping and robotic harvesting. This paper presents the use of a state-of-the-art object detection framework, Faster R-CNN, in the context of fruit detection in orchards, including mangoes, almonds and apples. Ablation studies are presented to better understand the practical deployment of the detection network, including how much training data is required to capture variability in the dataset. Data augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains, resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly from ImageNet features. Finally, to operate over orchard data containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced for the Faster R-CNN framework. The study has resulted in the best yet detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an F1-score of {\textgreater}0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the toxic effects of formulated herbicides, since many studies have been carried out using pure active molecules alone. In this work, we used as an eukaryotic model system an autochthonous wine yeast strain to investigate the effects of three commercial herbicides, currently used in the same geographical area from where this strain had been isolated. We carried out a comparative proteomic analysis to study the effects at the protein level of the herbicide-related stress, and found that the herbicides tested can alter the yeast proteome producing responses that share homologies with those observed treating yeast cells with the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or with well-known oxidizing agents. We evaluated, through redox-proteomic techniques, protein carbonylation as a biomarker of oxidative stress. This analysis showed that herbicide-induced carbonylation is a dynamic phenomenon with degrees of selectivity.},

abstract = {Thin, highly compliant sensing skins could provide valuable information for a host of grasping and locomotion tasks with minimal impact on the host system. We describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of a novel soft multi-axis force sensor made of highly deformable materials. The sensor is capable of measuring normal and in-plane shear forces. This soft sensor is composed of an elastomer (modulus: 69 kPa) with embedded microchannels filled with a conductive liquid. Depending on the magnitude and the direction of an applied force, all or part of the microchannels will be compressed, changing their electrical resistance. The two designs presented in this paper differ in their flexibility and channel configurations. The channel dimensions are approximately 200 × 200 $\mu$m and 300 × 700 $\mu$m for the two prototypes, respectively. The overall size of each sensor is 50 × 60 × 7 mm. The first prototype demonstrated force sensitivities along the two principal in-plane axes of 37.0 and −28.6 mV/N. The second prototype demonstrated the capability to detecting and differentiating normal and in-plane forces. In addition, this paper presents the results of a parameter study for different design configurations.},

abstract = {Optimization is the act of obtaining the best result under given circumstances. In design, construction, and maintenance of any engineering system, engineers have to take many technological and managerial decisions at several stages. The ultimate goal of all such decisions is either to minimize the effort required or to maximize the desired benefit. Since the effort required or the benefit desired in any practical situation can be expressed as a function of certain decision variables, optimization can be defined as the process of finding the conditions that give the maximum or minimum value of a function. It can be seen from Fig. 1.1 that if a point x corresponds to the minimum value of function f(x), the same point also corresponds to the maximum value of the negative of the function, f(x). Thus without loss of generality, optimization can be taken to mean minimization since the maximum of a function can be found by seeking the minimum of the negative of the same function.},

@article{Hidalgo-Carrio2017,
abstract = {Since early in robotics the performance of odometry techniques has been of constant research for mobile robots. This is due to its direct influence on localization. The pose error grows unbounded in dead-reckoning systems and its uncertainty has negative impacts in localization and mapping (i.e. SLAM). The dead-reckoning performance in terms of residuals, i.e. the difference between the expected and the real pose state, is related to the statistical error or uncertainty in probabilistic motion models. A novel approach to model odometry errors using Gaussian processes (GPs) is presented. The methodology trains a GP on the residual between the non-linear parametric motion model and the ground truth training data. The result is a GP over odometry residuals which provides an expected value and its uncertainty in order to enhance the belief with respect to the parametric model. The localization and mapping benefits from a comprehensive GP-odometry residuals model. The approach is applied to a planetary rover in an unstructured environment. We show that our approach enhances visual SLAM by efficiently computing image frames and effectively distributing keyframes.},

abstract = {High-resolution, quantitative data obtained by a human motion capture system can be used to better understand the cause of many diseases for effective treatments. Talking about the daily care of the aging population, two issues are critical. One is to continuously track motions and position of aging people when they are at home, inside a building or in the unknown environment; the other is to monitor their health status in real time when they are in the free-living environment. Continuous monitoring of human movement in their natural living environment potentially provide more valuable feedback than these in laboratory settings. However, it has been extremely challenging to go beyond laboratory and obtain accurate measurements of human physical activity in free-living environments. Commercial motion capture systems produce excellent in-studio capture and reconstructions, but offer no comparable solution for acquisition in everyday environments. Therefore in this dissertation, a wearable human motion analysis system is developed for continuously tracking human motions, monitoring health status, positioning human location and recording the itinerary. In this dissertation, two systems are developed for seeking aforementioned two goals: tracking human body motions and positioning a human. Firstly, an inertial- based human body motion tracking system with our developed inertial measurement unit (IMU) is introduced. By arbitrarily attaching a wearable IMU to each segment, segment motions can be measured and translated into inertial data by IMUs. A human model can be reconstructed in real time based on the inertial data by applying high efficient twists and exponential maps techniques. Secondly, for validating the feasibility of developed tracking system in the practical application, model- based quantification approaches for resting tremor and lower extremity bradykinesia in Parkinsons disease are proposed. By estimating all involved joint angles in PD symptoms based on reconstructed human model, angle characteristics with corresponding medical ratings are employed for training a HMM classifier for quantification. Besides, a pedestrian positioning system is developed for tracking users itinerary and positioning in the global frame. Corresponding tests have been carried out to assess the performance of each system.},

Pressing the surface of the elastomer with pressures in the range of 0-100 kPa will deform the cross-section of underlying channels and change their electric resistance by as much as 50{\%}. Microchannels with dimensions as small as 25 $\mu$m are obtained with a maskless, soft lithography process that utilizes direct laser exposure. Change in electrical resistance is measured as a function of the magnitude and area of the surface pressure as well as the cross-sectional geometry, depth and relative lateral position of the embedded channel. These experimentally measured values closely match closed-form theoretical predictions derived from plane strain elasticity and contact mechanics. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {An active ankle-foot orthoses (AAFO) is presented where the impedance of the orthotic joint is modulated throughout the walking cycle to treat drop-foot gait. During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop-foot participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of drop-foot gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.},

abstract = {Stroke patients often have flexor hypertonia and finger extensor weakness, which makes it difficult to open their affected hand for functional grasp. Because of this impairment, hand rehabilitation after stroke is essential for restoring functional independent lifestyles. The goal of this study is to develop a passive, lightweight, wearable device to assist with hand function during performance of activities of daily living. The device, Hand Spring Operated Movement Enhancer (HandSOME), assists with opening the patient's hand using a series of elastic cords that apply extension torques to the finger joints and compensates for the flexor hypertonia. Device design and calibration are described as well as functional and usability testing with stroke subjects with a wide range of hand impairments. In initial testing with eight stroke subjects with finger flexor hypertonia, use of the HandSOME significantly increased range of motion and functional ability (p=0.002) . There was some decrease in grip strength with the HandSOME device at the subject's ideal setting, however this was not statistically significant (p=0.167) and did not seem to have a significant effect on function. Overall HandSOME shows promise as a training tool to facilitate repetitive task practice for improving hand function in stroke patients. HandSOME can be used as part of a home-based therapy program, or as an orthotic for replacing lost function.},

abstract = {A soft robot is presented which replicates the ability of cephalopods to travel in the aquatic environment by means of pulsed jet propulsion. In this mode of propulsion, a discontinuous stream of fluid is ejected through a nozzle and rolls into a vortex ring. The occurrence of the vortex ring at the nozzle-exit plane has been proven to provide an additional thrust to the one generated by a continuous jet. A number of authors have experimented with vortex thrusting devices in the form of piston-cylinder chambers and oscillating diaphragms. Here, the focus is placed on designing a faithful biomimesis of the structural and functional character- istics of the Octopus vulgaris. To do so, the overall shape of this swimming robot is achieved by moulding a silicone cast of an ac- tual octopus, hence offering a credible replica of both the exterior and interior of an octopus mantle chamber. The activation cycle re- lies on the cable-driven contraction/release of the elastic chamber, which drives the fluid through a siphon-like nozzle and eventually provides the suitable thrust for propelling the robot. The proto- type presented herein demonstrates the fitness of vortex enhanced propulsion in designing soft unmanned underwater vehicles.},

The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up indi-vidual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper investigates these trade-offs on PRM graphs constructed in randomized environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation. We conclude that the method is preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm or the A * algorithm with conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.},

abstract = {—We address the problem of planning a path for a ground robot through unknown terrain, using observations from a flying robot. In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.},

abstract = {An efficient, high-speed quadruped robot is useful in applications spanning the service and entertainment industries. The military is also keenly interested in this platform as legged, robotic convoys for soldier support are becoming technically viable and a battlefield necessity with skirmishes in rough, unstructured terrain, inaccessible to wheels and tracks. Legs have the advantage in this domain and motivates the investigation of this mobility mechanism. The research presented here quantitatively analyzes a multi-body dynamics quadrupedal model with an articulated spine to evaluate the effects of speed and stride frequency on the energy requirements of the system. The planar articulated model consists of six planar, rigid bodies with a single joint in the middle of the torso. All joints are frictionless and mass is equally distributed in the limbs and torso. A model with the mid-torso joint removed, denoted as the rigid model, is used as a baseline comparison. Impulsive forces and torques are used to instantaneously reset the velocities at the phase transitions, allowing for ballistic trajectories during flight phases. Active torques at the haunch and shoulder joints are used during the stance phases to increase the model robustness. Simulations were conducted over effective high-speed gaits from 6.0-9.0 m/s. Stride frequencies were varied for both models. An evolutionary algorithm was employed to find plausible gaits based on biologically realistic constraints and bounds. The objective function for the optimization was cost of transport. Results show a decreasing cost of transport as speed increases for the articulated model with an optimal stride frequency of 3 s-1 and an increasing cost of transport with increasing speed for the rigid model at an optimal stride frequency of 1.4 s-1 , with a crossover in the cost of transport between the two models occurring at 7.0 m/s. The rigid model favors low speeds and stride frequencies at the cost of a large impulsive vertical force, driving the system through a long, gathered flight phase used to cover the long distances at the low stride frequencies. The articulated model prefers higher speeds and stride frequencies at the cost of a large impulsive torque in the back joint, akin to the contraction of abdomen muscles, preventing the collapse of the back. Thus, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of back articulation enables a more energetically efficient high-speed gait than a rigid back system, as seen in biological systems. Detailed analysis is provided to identify the mechanics associated with the optimal gaits of both the rigid and the articulated systems to support this claim.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design of a thumb exoskeleton for pediatric at-home rehabilitation. Pediatric disorders, such as cerebral palsy (CP) and stroke, can result in thumb in palm deformity greatly limiting hand function. This not only limits children's ability to perform activities of daily living but also limits important motor skill development. Specifically, the device, dubbed IOTA (Isolated Orthosis for Thumb Actuation) is a 2-DOF thumb exoskeleton that can actuate the carpometacarpal (CMC) and metacarpalphalangeal (MCP) joints through ranges of motion required for activities of daily living. The device consists of a lightweight hand-mounted mechanism that can be custom secured and aligned to the wearer. The mechanism is actuated via flexible cables that connect to a portable control box. Embedded encoders and bend sensors monitor the two degrees of freedom of the thumb and flexion/extension of the wrist. Using this platform, a number of control modes can be implemented that will enable the device to be intuitively controlled by a patient to assist with opposition grasp, fine motor control, and ultimately facilitate motor recovery. We envision this at-home device augmenting the current in-clinic therapy and enabling tele-rehabilitation where a clinician can remotely monitor a patient's usage and performance.},

abstract = {While a number of devices have recently been developed to facilitate hand rehabilitation after stroke, most place some restrictions on movement of the digits or arm. Thus, a novel glove was developed which can provide independent extension assistance to each digit while still allowing full arm movement. This pneumatic glove, the PneuGlove, can be used for training grasp-and-release movements either with real objects or with virtual objects in a virtual reality environment. Two groups of stroke survivors, with seven subjects in each group, completed a six-week rehabilitation training protocol, consisting of three 1-h sessions held each week. One group wore the PneuGlove during training, performed both within a novel virtual reality environment and outside of it with physical objects, while the other group completed the same training without the device. Across subjects, significant improvements were observed in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremity (p {\textless} 0.001), the hand/wrist portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (p {\textless} 0.001), the Box and Blocks test (p {\textless} 0.005), and palmar pinch strength (p {\textless} 0.005). While changes in the two groups were not statistically different, the group using the PneuGlove did show greater mean improvement on each of these measures, such as gains of 3.7 versus 2.4 points on the hand/wrist portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and 14 N versus 5 N in palmar pinch.},

Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that optimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with multiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware.},

abstract = { Detecting negative obstacles (ditches, potholes, and other depressions) is one of the most difficult problems in perception for autonomous, off-road navigation. Past work has largely relied on range imagery, because that is based on the geometry of the obstacle, is largely insensitive to illumination variables, and because there have not been other reliable alternatives. However, the visible aspect of negative obstacles shrinks rapidly with range, making them impossible to detect in time to avoid them at high speed. To relieve this problem, we show that the interiors of negative obstacles generally remain warmer than the surrounding terrain throughout the night, making thermal signature a stable property for night-time negative obstacle detection. Experimental results to date have achieved detection distances 45{\%} greater by using thermal signature than by using range data alone. Thermal signature is the first known observable with potential to reveal a deep negative obstacle without actually seeing far into it. Modeling solar illumination has potential to extend the usefulness of thermal signature through daylight hours.},

abstract = {One key benefit of legged robots is their ability to act on the environment by applying forces in a noncontinuous way in innumerous directions and magnitudes within their designed workspace. Most multi-legged robots are equipped with single-point-contact feet for the sake of simplicity in design and control. This paper focuses on a sophisticated lower limb system for a multi-legged robot to demonstrate the advantages of actuated multi-point-contact feet. Indications for these advantages can be found in nature, where the mechanical and sensory interaction of the feet with the substrate enables highly flexible ways of locomotion in animals and helps to optimize traction. Multi-point-contact feet even enable the transition from quadrupedal to bipedal walking, a dexterous behavior of ape-like mammals. To prove the technical plausibility of the planned leg structure, a first prototype including a lower leg, an actuated ankle joint, an attached foot structure, and a set of sensors with their required electronics was developed and integrated. Due to its characteristics, the lower limb - as a subcomponent of a legged robotic system - will extend the robot's knowledge of its internal and the environmental states. The mechanical and electronic design of the foot structure is presented in this paper as the basis for a later development of a biologically inspired control scheme.},

abstract = {We present a method to incorporate global orientation information from the sun into a visual odometry pipeline using only the existing image stream, where the sun is typically not visible. We leverage recent advances in Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks to train and implement a sun detection model that infers a three-dimensional sun direction vector from a single RGB image. Crucially, our method also computes a principled uncertainty associated with each prediction, using a Monte Carlo dropout scheme. We incorporate this uncertainty into a sliding window stereo visual odometry pipeline where accurate uncertainty estimates are critical for optimal data fusion. Our Bayesian sun detection model achieves a median error of approximately 12 degrees on the KITTI odometry benchmark training set, and yields improvements of up to 42{\%} in translational ARMSE and 32{\%} in rotational ARMSE compared to standard VO. An open source implementation of our Bayesian CNN sun estimator (Sun-BCNN) using Caffe is available at https://github. com/utiasSTARS/sun-bcnn-vo},

However, aid should only be given to the patient if needed and as much as it is required. To allow this, automatic self-initiated movement support and patient-cooperative control strategies have to be developed and integrated into assistive systems. In this work, we first give an overview of different kinds of neuromuscular diseases, review different forms of therapy, and explain possible fields of rehabilitation and benefits of robotic aided rehabilitation. Next, the mechanical design and control scheme of an upper limb orthosis for rehabilitation are presented. Two control models for the orthosis are explained which compute the triggering function and the level of assistance provided by the device. As input to the model fused sensor data from the orthosis and physiology data in terms of electromyography (EMG) signals are used.},

abstract = {A new type of wearable robot that assists the wearer with extra arms secured around the hips is presented. Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.},

abstract = {The paper presents a novel control method for the arm exoskeletons that takes into account the muscular force manipulability of the human arm. In contrast to classical controllers that provide assistance without considering the biomechanical properties of the human arm, we propose a control method that takes into account the configuration of the arm and the direction of the motion to effectively compensate the anisotropic property of the muscular manipulability of the human arm. Consequently, the proposed control method effectively maintains a spherical endpoint manipulability in the entire workspace of the arm. As a result, the proposed method allows the human using the exoskeleton to efficiently perform tasks in arm configurations that are normally unsuitable due to the low manipulability. We evaluated the proposed approach by a preliminary experimental study where a subject wearing a 2 DOF arm-exoskeleton had to move a 4 kg weight between several locations. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively augments the ability of human motor control to perform tasks equally well in the whole arm workspace that include configurations with low intrinsic manipulability.},

abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved state-of-theart performance in recognizing human activities, but often rely on utilizing background cues present in typical computer vision datasets that predominantly have a stationary camera. If these models are to be employed by autonomous robots in real world environments, they must be adapted to perform independently of background cues and camera motion effects. To address these challenges, we propose a new method that firstly generates generic action region proposals with good potential to locate one human action in unconstrained videos regardless of camera motion and then uses action proposals to extract and classify effective shape and motion features by a ConvNet framework. In a range of experiments, we demonstrate that by actively proposing action regions during both training and testing, state-of-the-art or better performance is achieved on benchmarks. We show the outperformance of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art in two new datasets; one emphasizes on irrelevant background, the other highlights the camera motion. We also validate our action recognition method in an abnormal behavior detection scenario to improve workplace safety. The results verify a higher success rate for our method due to the ability of our system to recognize human actions regardless of environment and camera motion.},

Robotic devices offer a unique training environment that may enhance outcomes beyond what is possible with conventional means. Robots apply forces to the hand, allowing completion of movements while preventing inappropriate movement patterns. Evidence from the literature is emerging that certain characteristics of the human-robot interaction are preferable. In light of this evidence, the robotic hand devices that have undergone clinical testing are reviewed, highlighting the authors' work in this area. Finally, suggestions for future work are offered. The ability to deliver therapy doses far higher than what has been previously tested is a potentially key advantage of robotic devices that needs further exploration. In particular, more efforts are needed to develop highly motivating home-based devices, which can increase access to high doses of assisted movement therapy.},

In this paper we analyze the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and its underlying logic of adaptive synergies, and propose a method to double its number of degree of actuation, with a very reduced impact on its mechanical complexity. This new design paradigm is based on constructive exploitation of friction phenomena. Based on this method, a novel prototype of under-actuated robot hand with two degrees of actuation is proposed, named Pisa/IIT SoftHand+.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In patients with stroke, the authors tested whether additional sensorimotor training of the paralyzed or paretic upper limb delivered by a robotic device enhanced motor outcome. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with stroke and hemiparesis or hemiplegia received standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and were randomly assigned either to receive robotic training (at least 25 hours) or exposure to the robotic device without training. Outcomes were assessed by the same masked raters, before treatment began and at the end of treatment, with the upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, the Motor Status score, the Motor Power score, and Functional Independence Measurement. RESULT: The robot treatment and control group had comparable clinical characteristics, lesion size, and pretreatment impairment scores. By the end of treatment, the robot-trained group demonstrated improvement in motor outcome for the trained shoulder and elbow (Motor Power score, p {\textless} 0.001; Motor Status score, p {\textless} 0. 01) that did not generalize to untrained wrist and hand. The robot-treated group also demonstrated significantly improved functional outcome (Functional Independence Measurement-Motor, p {\textless} 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Robot-delivered quantitative and reproducible sensorimotor training enhanced the motor performance of the exercised shoulder and elbow. The robot-treated group also demonstrated improved functional outcome. When added to standard multidisciplinary rehabilitation, robotics provides novel therapeutic strategies that focus on impairment reduction and improved motor performance.},

abstract = {— Tracking human gait accurately and robustly constitutes a key factor for a smart robotic walker, aiming to provide assistance to patients with different mobility impair-ment. A context-aware assistive robot needs constant knowledge of the user's kinematic state to assess the gait status and adjust its movement properly to provide optimal assistance. In this work, we experimentally validate the performance of two gait tracking algorithms using data from elderly patients; the first algorithm employs a Kalman Filter (KF), while the second one tracks the user legs separately using two probabilistically associated Particle Filters (PFs). The algorithms are compared according to their accuracy and robustness, using data captured from real experiments, where elderly subjects performed spe-cific walking scenarios with physical assistance from a prototype Robotic Rollator. Sensorial data were provided by a laser rangefinder mounted on the robotic platform recording the movement of the user's legs. The accuracy of the proposed algorithms is analysed and validated with respect to ground truth data provided by a Motion Capture system tracking a set of visual markers worn by the patients. The robustness of the two tracking algorithms is also analysed comparatively in a complex maneuvering scenario. Current experimental findings demonstrate the superior performance of the PFs in difficult cases of occlusions and clutter, where KF tracking often fails.},

abstract = {The behaviors of the animals or embodied agents are characterized by the dynamic coupling between the brain, the body, and the environment. This implies that control, which is conventionally thought to be handled by the brain or a controller, can partially be outsourced to the physical body and the interaction with the environment. This idea has been demonstrated in a number of recently constructed robots, in particular from the field of "soft robotics". Soft robots are made of a soft material introducing high-dimensionality, non-linearity, and elasticity, which often makes the robots difficult to control. Biological systems such as the octopus are mastering their complex bodies in highly sophisticated manners by capitalizing on their body dynamics. We will demonstrate that the structure of the octopus arm cannot only be exploited for generating behavior but also, in a sense, as a computational resource. By using a soft robotic arm inspired by the octopus we show in a number of experiments how control is partially incorporated into the physical arm's dynamics and how the arm's dynamics can be exploited to approximate non-linear dynamical systems and embed non-linear limit cycles. Future application scenarios as well as the implications of the results for the octopus biology are also discussed.},

abstract = {Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) is a time critical task. Rescue teams have to explore a large terrain within a short amount of time in order to locate survivors after a disaster. One goal in Rescue Robotics is to have a team of heterogeneous robots that explore autonomously, or partially guided by an incident commander, the disaster area. Their task is to jointly create a map of the terrain and to register victim locations, which can further be utilized by human task forces for rescue. Basically, the robots have to solve autonomously in real-time the problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), consisting of a continuous state estimation problem and a discrete data association problem. Extraordinary circumstances after a real disaster make it very hard to apply common techniques. Many of these have been developed under strong assumptions, for example, they require polygonal structures, such as typically found in office-like environments. Furthermore, most techniques are not deployable in real-time. In this paper we propose real-time solutions for localization and mapping, which all have been extensively evaluated within the test arenas of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We specifically deal with the problems of vision-based pose tracking on tracked vehicles, the building of globally consistent maps based on a network of RFID tags, and the building of elevation maps from readings of a tilted Laser Range Finder (LRF). Our results show that these methods lead under modest computational requirements to good results within the utilized testing arenas.},

@article{Penkov2017,
abstract = {— It is natural for humans to work with abstract plans which are often an intuitive and concise way to rep-resent a task. However, high level task descriptions contain symbols and concepts which need to be grounded within the environment if the plan is to be executed by an autonomous robot. The problem of learning the mapping between abstract plan symbols and their physical instances in the environment is known as the problem of physical symbol grounding. In this paper, we propose a framework for Grounding and Learning Instances through Demonstration and Eye tracking (GLIDE). We associate traces of task demonstration to a sequence of fixations which we call fixation programs and exploit their properties in order to perform physical symbol grounding. We formulate the problem as a probabilistic generative model and present an algorithm for computationally feasible inference over the proposed model. A key aspect of our work is that we estimate fixation locations within the environment which enables the appearance of symbol instances to be learnt. Instance learning is a crucial ability when the robot does not have any knowledge about the model or the appearance of the symbols referred to in the plan instructions. We have conducted human experiments and demonstrate that GLIDE successfully grounds plan symbols and learns the appearance of their instances, thus enabling robots to autonomously execute tasks in initially unknown environments.},

abstract = {A wearable upper-extremity (UE) exoskeleton robot (RUPERT: Robotic UPper Extremity Repetitive Trainer) targeted for clinical and home-based rehabilitation was jointly developed by Kinetic Muscles Inc. (Tempe, AZ) and Arizona State University. In an effort to keep the mechanical hardware of the robot simple, lightweight and economical, an underactuated design was adopted for the robot's mechanical structure. This underactuated design of the robot which reduces its manipulability, necessitates the demonstration of the feasibility of using the robot for assisted task practice. Thus, the general objective of the dissertation was to develop a control system so that RUPERT can be used as an interactive and cost-effective therapeutic system for assisting functional therapy tasks, despite its simple and underactuated design. The first specific goal of the dissertation was to develop a feedback controller for RUPERT to establish that the robot can be used for the assisted practice of simple therapy tasks, such as reaching movements. This feedback controller supports two adaptive robotic therapy modes that are based on the idea of maximizing active participation from the stroke subject. These two robotic therapy modes were tested on three subjects to evaluate the feasibility of using RUPERT for assisting reaching movements, and also the adaptive capabilities of the two therapy modes. The results from this study indicate that RUPERT can be used for the assisted practice of reaching movements, despite its underactuated design. The two therapy modes were also able to adapt the robot's behavior during therapy based on a subject's motor ability. The second specific goal of the dissertation was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a hybrid approach to extend the therapeutic utility of RUPERT for assisting real world reach-and-grasp movements. This was achieved by developing a preliminary hybrid system that used RUPERT for assisting arm movements and an electrical stimulation system for assisting hand movements. The system also consisted of an instrumented glove and a balloon like structure that simulates the object used for reach-and-grasp movement practice. Additionally an adaptive controller was developed for modulating the assistance provided to the reaching and grasping components of reach-and-grasp movements. This hybrid system was tested on three stroke subjects for assisting reach-and-grasp movement (both in seated and standing positions). The results from this study not only suggest that a hybrid approach is feasible for reach-and-grasp movement practice with RUPERT, but also that a wearable robot, like RUPERT, can be used for real world task practice by adding one or more simple and inexpensive components into the system. Overall, the work presented in this dissertation acts as stepping stone for the development of a simple, portable, and affordable UE robotic system for real world task-oriented therapy in situations mimicking real-life in both clinical and home environments.

abstract = {Urban hydrology is an applied science that will have an increasing role to play in the sustainability of human societies. Facing present growth of urban population, it is increasingly difficult to find and utilize new sources of water necessary to satisfy growing water demand. For the poor, the residents of peri-urban and squatter areas, an ultimate poverty, the poverty of lacking clean water, is a result. To remove this kind of poverty should be a first priority target for all people and, especially, for people dealing with water management in urban areas. Growth of urban areas brings significant changes in physical properties of land surface increasing integrated vulnerability of inhabitants, agricultural land and rural ecological life supporting systems. Performance of technical solutions depends on climate as well as on social, economical and cultural conditions. Findings from urban hydrological studies based on collection of urban hydrological data, calculations and modeling constitute a necessary fundamental for meaningful water management not only in urban areas but also in entire river basins. Future challenges in urban water management include development of new technical solutions as well as logistic and organizational methods in order to turn present problems into future opportunities. The following current and emerging challenges are discussed in the paper: delivery of drinking water supply for growing cities, water for sanitation versus sanitation without water, recycling of wastewater nutrients, wastewater irrigation, urban agriculture, water to feed depleted aquifers, thoughts about possible future new system solutions, social equity and transfer of knowledge and new technology.},

abstract = {This work presents a soft hand capable of robustly grasping and identifying objects based on internal state measurements. A highly compliant hand allows for intrinsic robustness to grasping uncertainty, but the specific configuration of the hand and object is not known, leaving undetermined if a grasp was successful in picking up the right object. A soft finger was adapted and combined to form a three finger gripper that can easily be attached to existing robots, for example, to the wrist of the Baxter robot. Resistive bend sensors were added within each finger to provide a configuration estimate sufficient for distinguishing between a set of objects. With one data point from each finger, the object grasped by the gripper can be identified. A clustering algorithm to find the correspondence for each grasped object is presented for both enveloping grasps and pinch grasps. This hand is a first step towards robust proprioceptive soft grasping.},

abstract = {We propose a probabilistic filtering method which fuses joint measurements with depth images to yield a precise, real-time estimate of the end-effector pose in the camera frame. This avoids the need for frame transformations when using it in combination with visual object tracking methods. Precision is achieved by modeling and correcting biases in the joint measurements as well as inaccuracies in the robot model, such as poor extrinsic camera calibration. We make our method computationally efficient through a principled combination of Kalman filtering of the joint measurements and asynchronous depth-image updates based on the Coordinate Particle Filter. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on a dataset recorded from a real robotic platform, annotated with ground truth from a motion capture system. We show that our approach is robust and accurate even under challenging conditions such as fast motion, significant and long-term occlusions, and time-varying biases. We release the dataset along with open-source code of our approach to allow for quantitative comparison with alternative approaches.},

abstract = {Spinal cord and other local injuries often lead to partial paralysis while the brain stays fully functional. When this partial paralysis occurs in the hand, these individuals are not able to execute daily activities on their own even if their arms are functional. To remedy this problem, a lightweight, low-profile orthotic exoskeleton has been designed to restore dexterity to paralyzed hands. The exoskeleton's movements are controlled by the user's available electromyography (EMG) signals. The device has two actuators controlling the index finger flexion that can be used to perform a pinching motion against a fixed thumb. Using this orthotic device, a new control technique was developed to allow for a natural reaching and pinching sequence by utilizing the natural residual muscle activation patterns. To design this controller, two actuator control algorithms were explored with a quadriplegic (C5/C6) subject and it was determined that a simple binary control algorithm allowed for faster interaction with objects over a variable control algorithm. The binary algorithm was then used as an enabling algorithm to activate the exoskeleton movements when the natural sequence of muscle activities found a pattern related to a pinch. This natural pinching technique has shown significant promise toward realistic neural control of wearable robotic devices to assist paralyzed individuals.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to balance assistance and joint load reduction for human bipedal walking. We introduce a new type of wearable robot, called Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), that provides two additional legs for augmenting stability and reducing the loads on human leg joints. Unlike exoskeletons, the SRL is kinematically independent of the human skeletal structure, and can therefore take an arbitrary posture to provide optimal assistance in coordination with human motions. Furthermore, unlike crutches, canes, and other balance assistance equipment, the SRL can provide balancing support autonomously and thereby free the human arms from holding those tools. First, the new design concept and balance assistance strategy are described, followed by kinematic and static modeling. Two gate patterns of the combined human and SRL are discussed. Optimal gate synthesis that maximizes the area of support polygon is discussed. Finally, the gate control strategies are implemented on a prototype SRL, using body motion sensors to enable real-time, seamless coordination between the user and the robot.},

The training and testing sets consist of controllers based on a full dynamic model, virtual constraints, and parameter optimization to meet torque limits, friction cone, and environmental conditions. The controllers are designed to induce periodic walking gaits at various speeds, both forward and backward, and for various constant ground slopes, flat ground, uphill, and downhill. They are also designed to induce aperiodic gaits that transition among a subset of the periodic gaits in a fixed number of steps. In experiments, the learned policy allows a 3D bipedal robot to recover from a significant kick. It also enables the robot to walk down a 22 degree slope and walk on sinusoidally varying terrain, all without using a camera.},

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of active hand exoskeletons for applications in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive robotics. The main requirements of these hand exoskeleton devices are also identified and the mechanical designs of existing devices are classified.

Using a finite-time optimal control framework, feature correspondence is implicitly solved for each new image during the control selection, alleviating the need for additional image processing and feature tracking. The proposed approach demonstrates mild robustness properties and leads to ac-ceptable or improved image feature behavior and robot trajectories compared to classical image-based visual servoing, particularly for underactuated robots. As such, preliminary experimental results using a small unmanned quadrotor are also presented.},

abstract = {Soft robotics is a challenging and promising branch of robotics. It can drive significant improvements across various fields of traditional robotics, and contribute solutions to basic problems such as locomotion and manipulation in unstructured environments. A challenging task for soft robotics is to build and control soft robots able to exert effective forces. In recent years, biology has inspired several solutions to such complex problems. This study aims at investigating the smart solution that the Octopus vulgaris adopts to perform a crawling movement, with the same limbs used for grasping and manipulation. An ad hoc robot was designed and built taking as a reference a biological hypothesis on crawling. A silicone arm with cables embedded to replicate the functionality of the arm muscles of the octopus was built. This novel arm is capable of pushing-based locomotion and object grasping, mimicking the movements that octopuses adopt when crawling. The results support the biological observations and clearly show a suitable way to build a more complex soft robot that, with minimum control, can perform diverse tasks.},

The numerical models take into account the non-linearity of the expanding rubber inner tube, and of the mechanism for transferring load to the braided cords surrounding the tube. Because of its own fabrication, McKibben muscle model may capture the initial backslash between rubber tube and cords. Despite of the McKibben specimen, a straight fiber muscle prototype was fabricated on purpose in the laboratory. In order to validate the numerical models, numerous experimental tests were carried out. The numerical results showed a good agreement with the data measured experimentally in terms of muscle pull force and of its deformed shape. Finally, the models of two muscles similar in terms of input energy allow their performances to be compared. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Autonomous Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems can utilize fleet management strategies in order to provide a high customer quality of service (QoS). Previous works on autonomous MOD systems have developed methods for rebalancing single capacity vehicles, where QoS is maintained through large fleet sizing. This work focuses on MOD systems utilizing a small number of vehicles, such as those found on a campus, where additional vehicles cannot be introduced as demand for rides increases. A predictive positioning method is presented for improving customer QoS by identifying key locations to position the fleet in order to minimize expected customer wait time. Ridesharing is introduced as a means for improving customer QoS as arrival rates increase. However, with ridesharing perceived QoS is dependent on an often unknown customer preference. To address this challenge, a customer ratings model, which learns customer preference from a 5-star rating, is developed and incorporated directly into a ridesharing algorithm. The predictive positioning and ridesharing methods are applied to simulation of a real-world campus MOD system.A combined predictive positioning and ridesharing approach is shown to reduce customer service times by up to 29{\%} and the customer ratings model is shown to provide the best overall MOD fleet management performance over a range of customer preferences.},

abstract = {Context Single-site studies suggest that a 2-week program of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for patients more than 1 year after stroke who maintain some hand and wrist movement can improve upper extremity function that persists for at least 1 year. Objective To compare the effects of a 2-week multisite program of CIMT vs usual and customary care on improvement in upper extremity function among patients who had a first stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months. Design and Setting The Extremity Constraint Induced Therapy Evaluation (EXCITE) trial, a prospective, single-blind, randomized, multisite clinical trial conducted at 7 US academic institutions between January 2001 and January 2003. Participants Two hundred twenty-two individuals with predominantly ischemic stroke. Interventions Participants were assigned to receive either CIMT (n = 106; wearing a restraining mitt on the less-affected hand while engaging in repetitive task practice and behavioral shaping with the hemiplegic hand) or usual and customary care (n = 116; ranging from no treatment after concluding formal rehabilitation to pharmacologic or physiotherapeutic interventions); patients were stratified by sex, prestroke dominant side, side of stroke, and level of paretic arm function. Main Outcome Measures The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), a measure of laboratory time and strength-based ability and quality of movement (functional ability), and the Motor Activity Log (MAL), a measure of how well and how often 30 common daily activities are performed. Results From baseline to 12 months, the CIMT group showed greater improvements than the control group in both the WMFT Performance Time (decrease in mean time from 19.3 seconds to 9.3 seconds [52{\%} reduction] vs from 24.0 seconds to 17.7 seconds [26{\%} reduction]; between-group difference, 34{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 12{\%}-51{\%}]; P{\textless}.001) and in the MAL Amount of Use (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.21 to 2.13 vs from 1.15 to 1.65; between-group difference, 0.43 [95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.80]; P{\textless}.001) and MAL Quality of Movement (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.26 to 2.23 vs 1.18 to 1.66; between-group difference, 0.48 [95{\%} CI, 0.13-0.84]; P{\textless}.001). The CIMT group achieved a decrease of 19.5 in self-perceived hand function difficulty (Stroke Impact Scale hand domain) vs a decrease of 10.1 for the control group (between-group difference, 9.42 [95{\%} CI, 0.27-18.57]; P=.05). Conclusion Among patients who had a stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months, CIMT produced statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in arm motor function that persisted for at least 1 year.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the design of a robotic arm inspired to the anatomy and morphology of an octopus arm. The octopus is a boneless animal and its amazing dexterity is due to its muscular structure where longitudinal (axial), transverse (radial) and oblique muscles seamlessly interact while preserving hydrostaticity i.e. volume conservation ({\&}{\#}x201C;muscular hydrostat{\&}{\#}x201D;). Mimicking some features of the octopus is instrumental to design a dexterous and compliant system. After analysing the relevant anatomical and morphological characteristics of the octopus arm, the key biomechanical features of interest to the design of a robotic arm have been identified. A design methodology has been developed based on the analysis of the muscular hydrostat properties. A prototype arm has been built using bespoke contracting pneumatic muscles and expanding elements. In the current stage of development the system has 15 actuated degrees of motion (DOM) and 8 degrees of freedom (DOF), all independently controllable through valves and a dedicated electronics and software interface. Pros and cons of the current design as well as practical prototyping trade-offs are thoroughly described.},

Additionally, three distinct casting-based fabrication processes are explored: lamination-based casting, retractable-pin-based casting, and lost-wax-based casting. Furthermore, two ways of fabricating a multiple DOF robot are explored: casting the complete robot as a whole and casting single degree of freedom (DOF) segments with subsequent concatenation. We experimentally validate each soft actuator morphology and fabrication process by creating multiple physical soft robot prototypes.},

abstract = {This paper presents a force-based control mode for a hand exoskeleton. This device has been developed with focus on support of the rehabilitation process after hand injuries or strokes. As the device is designed for the later use on patients, which have limited hand mobility, fast undesired movements have to be averted. Safety precautions in the hardware and software design of the system must be taken to ensure this. The construction allows controlling motions of the finger joints. However, due to friction in gears and mechanical construction, it is not possible to move finger joints within the construction without help of actuators. Therefore force sensors are integrated into the construction to sense force exchanged between human and exoskeleton. These allow the human to control the movements of the hand exoskeleton, which is useful to teach new trajectories or can be used for diagnostic purposes. The force control scheme presented in this paper uses the force sensor values to generate a trajectory which is executed by a position control loop based on sliding mode control},

abstract = {This letter summarizes some known properties and also presents several new properties of the Numerical Integration (NI) method for time-optimal trajectory planning along a specified path. The contribution is that rigorous mathematical proofs of these properties are presented, most of which cannot be found in existing literatures. We first give some properties regarding switch points and accelerating/decelerating curves of the NI method. Then, for the fact that when kinematic constraints are considered, the original version of NI which only considers torque constraints may result in failure of trajectory planning, we give the concrete failure conditions with rigorous mathematical proof. Accordingly, a failure detection algorithm is given in a run-and-test manner. Some simulation results on a unicycle vehicle are provided to verify those presented properties. Note that though those known properties are not discovered first, their mathematical proofs are given first in this letter. The detailed proofs make the theory of NI more complete and help interested readers to gain a thorough understanding of the method.},

abstract = {— Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a deep learning technique that has achieved state-of-the-art prediction performance in computer vision and robotics, but assume the input data can be formatted as an image or video (e.g. predicting a robot grasping location given RGB-D image input). This paper considers the problem of augmenting a traditional CNN for handling image-like input (called main-channel input) with additional, highly predictive, non-image-like input (called side-channel input). An example of such a task would be predicting whether a robot path is collision-free given an occupancy grid of the environment and the path's start and goal configurations; the occupancy grid is the main-channel and the start and goal are the side-channel. This paper presents several candidate network architectures for doing so. Empirical tests on robot collision prediction and control problems compare the the proposed architectures in terms of learning speed, memory usage, learning capacity, and susceptibility to overfitting.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of safe mission$\backslash$r$\backslash$nplanning of dynamic systems operating under uncertain environments.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMuch of the prior work on achieving robust and safe$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncontrol requires solving second-order cone programs (SOCP).$\backslash$r$\backslash$nUnfortunately, existing general purpose SOCP methods are$\backslash$r$\backslash$noften infeasible for real-time robotic tasks due to high memory$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand computational requirements imposed by existing general$\backslash$r$\backslash$noptimization methods. The key contribution of this paper is a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfast and memory-efficient algorithm for SOCP that would enable$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrobust and safe mission planning on-board robots in realtime.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nOur algorithm does not have any external dependency,$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncan efficiently utilize warm start provided in safe planning$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsettings, and in fact leads to significant speed up over standard$\backslash$r$\backslash$noptimization packages (like SDPT3) for even standard SOCP$\backslash$r$\backslash$nproblems. For example, for a standard quadrotor problem, our$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmethod leads to speedup of 1000× over SDPT3 without any$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndeterioration in the solution quality.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nOur method is based on two insights: a) SOCPs can be$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninterpreted as optimizing a function over a polytope with$\backslash$r$\backslash$ninfinite sides, b) a linear function can be efficiently optimized$\backslash$r$\backslash$nover this polytope. We combine the above observations with$\backslash$r$\backslash$na novel utilization of Wolfe's algorithm [1] to obtain an$\backslash$r$\backslash$nefficient optimization method that can be easily implemented on$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsmall embedded devices. In addition to the above mentioned$\backslash$r$\backslash$nalgorithm, we also design a two-level sensing method based$\backslash$r$\backslash$non Gaussian Process for complex obstacles with non-linear$\backslash$r$\backslash$nboundaries such as a cylinder.},

Extraction of ground water in excess of replenishment has created an overdraft of approximately 1. 7 million acre-feet per year, with pumping lifts of up to 600 feet. Where alternative surface water supplies are not available, overdrafting with increasing pumping lifts and costs will continue to the extent that an economic return to the pumper is realized. The opportunity exists to stretch the ground water supplies and more effectively utilize imported surface supplies at lower overall cost through a number of conjunctive use programs. These include water exchanges between entities, ground water banking arrangements, construction of ground water recharge and extraction facilities, additional distribution systems and use of off-stream aqueduct capacity to convey surplus water from the Sacramento Valley.},

We propose a distributed measure of the interaction pressure over the whole contact area between the user and the machine as an alternative measurement method of human-robot interaction. To obtain this measure, an array of newly-developed soft silicone pressure sensors is inserted between the limb and the mechanical interface that connects the robot to the user, in direct contact with the wearer's skin. Compared to state-of-the-art measures, the advantage of this approach is that it allows for a distributed measure of the interaction pressure, which could be useful for the assessment of safety and comfort of human-robot interaction. This paper presents the new sensor and its characterization, and the development of an interaction measurement apparatus, which is applied to a lower-limb rehabilitation robot. The system is calibrated, and an example its use during a prototypical gait training task is presented.},

abstract = {MSC.Software Corporation, the worldwide leader in rubber analysis, would like to share some of our experiences and expertise in analyzing elastomers with you. This White Paper introduces you to the nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) of rubber-like polymers generally grouped under the name " elastomers " . You may have a nonlinear rubber problem—and not even know it... The Paper is primarily intended for two types of readers: ENGINEERING MANAGERS who are involved in manufacturing of elastomeric components, but do not currently possess nonlinear FEA tools, or who may have an educational/professional background other than mechanical engineering. DESIGN ENGINEERS who are perhaps familiar with linear, or even nonlinear, FEA concepts but would like to know more about analyzing elastomers. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic principles in strength of materials theory. The contents of this White Paper are intentionally organized for the convenience of these two kinds of readers. For an " Engineering Manager " , topics of interest include, an Executive Summary to obtain an overview of the subject, the Case Studies to see some real-world rubber FEA applications, and any other industry specific topics. The " Design Engineer " , on the other hand, can examine the significant features on analysis of elastomers (which constitute the bulk of the Paper). The Appendices describe the physics and mechanical properties of rubber, proper modeling of incompressibility in rubber FEA, and most importantly, testing methods for determination of material properties. Simulation issues and useful hints are found throughout the text and in the Case Studies. Rubber FEA is an extensive subject, which involves rubber chemistry, manufacturing processes, material characterization, finite element theory, and the latest advances in computational mechanics. A selected list of Suggestions for Further Reading is included. These references cite some of the most recent research on FEA of elastomers and demonstrate practical applications. They are categorized by subject for readers convenience.},

With this analysis and experimental values for the trunk parameters, the apparent trunk stiffness Ea is estimated for the living animal. For an Asian elephant with a maximum compression strain of 33 percent, Ea is of the order of 10(6) N/m2. The continuum model is quite general and may be applied to similar nonskeletal appendages and bodies of other animals.},

abstract = {— Communication with a robot using brain activity from a human collaborator could provide a direct and fast feedback loop that is easy and natural for the human, thereby enabling a wide variety of intuitive interaction tasks. This paper explores the application of EEG-measured error-related potentials (ErrPs) to closed-loop robotic control. ErrP signals are particularly useful for robotics tasks because they are nat-urally occurring within the brain in response to an unexpected error. We decode ErrP signals from a human operator in real time to control a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot during a binary object selection task. We also show that utilizing a secondary interactive error-related potential signal generated during this closed-loop robot task can greatly improve classifi-cation performance, suggesting new ways in which robots can acquire human feedback. The design and implementation of the complete system is described, and results are presented for real-time closed-loop and open-loop experiments as well as offline analysis of both primary and secondary ErrP signals. These experiments are performed using general population subjects that have not been trained or screened. This work thereby demonstrates the potential for EEG-based feedback methods to facilitate seamless robotic control, and moves closer towards the goal of real-time intuitive interaction.},

abstract = {Current self-driving car systems operate well in sunny weather but struggle in adverse conditions. One of the most commonly encountered adverse conditions involves water on the road caused by rain, sleet, melting snow or flooding. While some advances have been made in using conventional RGB camera and LIDAR technology for detecting water hazards, other sources of information such as polarization offer a promising and potentially superior approach to this problem in terms of performance and cost. In this paper, we present a novel stereo-polarization system for detecting and tracking water hazards based on polarization and color variation of reflected light. To evaluate this system, we present a new large water-on-road datasets spanning approximately 2 km of driving in various on road and off road conditions and demonstrate for the first time reliable water detection and tracking over a wide range of realistic car driving water conditions using polarized vision as the primary sensing modality. Our system successfully detects water hazards up to 80m and doubles the success detection range as compared to a similar polarized camera system. Finally, we discuss several interesting challenges and propose future research directions for further improving robust autonomous car perception in hazardous wet conditions using polarization sensors.},

abstract = {Wearable sensors for gait analysis are attracting wide interest. In this paper, a wearable ground reaction force (GRF) sensor system and its application to measure extrinsic gait variability are presented. To validate the GRF and centre of pressure (CoP) measurements of the sensor system and examine the effectiveness of the proposed method for gait analysis, we conducted an experimental study on seven volunteer subjects. Based on the assessment of the influence of the sensor system on natural gait, we found that no significant differences were found for almost all measured gait parameters (p-values 0.05). As for measurement accuracy, the root mean square (RMS) differences for the two transverse components and the vertical component of the GRF were 7.2{\%} 0.8{\%} and 9.0{\%} 1{\%} of the maximum of each transverse component and 1.5{\%} 0.9{\%} of the maximum vertical component of GRF, respectively. The RMS distance between both CoP measurements was 1.4{\%} 0.2{\%} of the length of the shoe. The area of CoP distribution on the foot-plate and the average coefficient of variation of the triaxial GRF, are the introduced parameters for analysing extrinsic gait variability. Based on a statistical analysis of the results of the tests with subjects wearing the sensor system, we found that the proposed parameters changed according to walking speed and turning (p-values 0.05). 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {— Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are some of the most promising robotic platforms in a variety of applications due to their high mobility. Their restricted computational and payload capabilities, however, translate into significant challenges in automating their navigation. With Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) systems recently demonstrated to be employable onboard UAVs, the focus fall on path-planning on the quest of achieving autonomous navigation. With the vast body of path-planning literature often assuming perfect maps or maps known a priori, the biggest challenge lies in dealing with the robustness and accuracy limitations of onboard SLAM in real missions. In this spirit, this paper proposes a path-planning algorithm designed to work in the loop of the SLAM estimation of a monocular-inertial system. This point-to-point planner is demonstrated to navigate in an unknown environment using the incrementally generated SLAM map, while dictating the navigation strategy for preferable acquisition of sensor data for better estimations within SLAM. A thorough evaluation testbed of both simulated and real data is presented, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed pipeline against the state-of-the-art and its dramatically lower computational complexity, revealing its suitability to UAV navigation.},

abstract = {The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms composed of a peculiar muscular structure, named a muscular hydrostat. The octopus arms provide it with both locomotion and grasping capabilities, thanks to the fact that their stiffness can change over a wide range and can be controlled through combined contractions of the muscles. The muscular hydrostat can better be seen as a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tissues are such that the interaction with the environment (i.e., water) is exploited to simplify control. Thanks to this effective mechanism of embodied intelligence, the octopus can control a very high number of degrees of freedom, with relatively limited computing resources. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a good model for embodied intelligence and for soft robotics. The prototype of a robot arm has been built based on an artificial muscular hydrostat inspired to the muscular hydrostat of the Octopus vulgaris. The prototype presents the morphology of the biological model and the broad arrangement of longitudinal and transverse muscles. Actuation is obtained with cables (longitudinally) and with shape memory alloy springs (transversally). The robot arm combines contractions and it can show the basic movements of the octopus arm, like elongation, shortening and bending, in water.},

Next, an experimental evaluation of the coefficient of static friction between these objects and a number of common household surfaces is performed. A key failure mode in unstructured object grasping occurs when the manipulator applies large contact forces that move the object out of grasp range. These results therefore give insight into the likelihood of a target object remaining in place to be successfully grasped in the presence of contact forces from the robot arm. This paper also presents a new classification of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), putting forth a standard categorization for the application of robotics in human environments.

The mechanical function of this special structure depends on the organization of muscle cells in the various muscle groups, the distribution of muscle and nerve cells along the arm and the connective tissue/muscle relation. Here we characterized the distribution of the muscle and the nerve cells along the arm. To do this, we used histological (Nissl staining and Sirius red connective staining) and immunohistochemical reactions (alpha Actin, PO and beta III Tubulin) to identify cell types and estimate the ratio between the volumes occupied by the nervous and the muscle systems along the arm. We thus obtained a comprehensive view on the structural organization of sensory and motor components acting at different levels along an octopus arm. Given the increasing interest to bio-roboticists in highly flexible biological structures this study may provide important insights for the design of a biomimetic arm.},

Our numerical models developed using the finite element method can predict the actuator behavior at large mechanical strains to allow efficient design iterations for system optimization. Based on two distinctive actuator prototypes' (linear and bending actuators) experimental results that include free displacement and blocked-forces, we have validated the efficacy of the numerical models. The presented extensive investigation of mechanical performance for soft actuators with varying geometric parameters demonstrates the practical application of the design tool, and the robustness of the actuator hardware design, towards diverse soft robotic systems for a wide set of assistive wearable technologies, including replicating the motion of several parts of the human body.},

Robots should be equipped with models that are impervious to these factors in order to be operable and more importantly to ensure safety in the real-world. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation architecture and the convoluted mixture of deep experts (CMoDE) fusion technique that enables a multi-stream deep neural network to learn features from complementary modalities and spectra, each of which are specialized in a subset of the input space. Our model adaptively weighs class-specific features of expert networks based on the scene condition and further learns fused representations to yield robust segmentation. We present results from experimentation on three publicly available datasets that contain diverse conditions including rain, summer, winter, dusk, fall, night and sunset, and show that our approach exceeds the state-of-the-art. In addition, we evaluate the performance of autonomously traversing several kilometres of a forested environment using only the segmentation for perception.},

abstract = {— We explore a temporal decomposition of dynamics in order to enhance policy learning with unknown dynamics. There are model-free methods and model-based methods for policy learning with unknown dynamics, but both approaches have problems: in general, model-free methods have less gener-alization ability, while model-based methods are often limited by the assumed model structure or need to gather many samples to make models. We consider a temporal decomposition of dynamics to make learning models easier. To obtain a policy, we apply differential dynamic programming (DDP). A feature of our method is that we consider decomposed dynamics even when there is no action to be taken, which allows us to decom-pose dynamics more flexibly. Consequently learned dynamics become more accurate. Our DDP is a first-order gradient descent algorithm with a stochastic evaluation function. In DDP with learned models, typically there are many local maxima. In order to avoid them, we consider multiple criteria evaluation functions. In addition to the stochastic evaluation function, we use a reference value function. This method was verified with pouring simulation experiments where we created complicated dynamics. The results show that we can optimize actions with DDP while learning dynamics models.},

Reinforcement learning is a promising alternative that aims to automate this process, yet often requires too many experiments to be practical. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by exploiting prior knowledge from simulations, which are readily available for most robotic platforms. Specifically, we extend Entropy Search, a Bayesian optimization algorithm that maximizes information gain from each experiment, to the case of multiple information sources. The result is a principled way to automatically combine cheap, but inaccurate information from simulations with expensive and accurate physical experiments in a cost-effective manner. We apply the resulting method to a cart-pole system, which confirms that the algorithm can find good control policies with fewer experiments than standard Bayesian optimization on the physical system only.},

One such nonpotable application is at thermoelectric power plants since these facilities require cooling, often using large volumes of freshwater. To evaluate the geographic, technologic, and economic feasibility of using reclaimed water to cool thermoelectric power plants, we developed a spatially resolved model of existing power plants. Our model integrates data on power plant and municipal wastewater treatment plant operations into a combined geographic information systems and optimization approach to evaluate the feasibility of cooling system retrofits. We applied this broadly applicable methodology to 125 power plants in Texas as a test case. Results show that sufficient reclaimed water resources exist within 25 miles of 92 power plants (representing 61{\%} of capacity and 50{\%} of generation in our sample), with most of these facilities meeting both...},

A novel response function based on the surface normals is used in combination with the Harris corner detector for selecting keypoints in the scene. A strategy that uses the depth information for scale estimation and background elimination is proposed to select the neighbourhood around the keypoints in order to build precise invariant descriptors. Proposed descriptor relies on the ordering of both grayscale intensity and shape information in the neighbourhood. Comprehensive experiments which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed RGB-D feature when compared with CSHOT and LOIND are presented. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of incorporating texture and shape information in the design of both the detector and the descriptor by demonstrating the enhanced performance of CSHOT and LOIND when combined with RISAS detector.},

abstract = {To date, most modular robotic systems lack flexibility when increasing the number of modules due to their hard building blocks and rigid connection mechanisms. In order to improve adaptation to environmental changes, softness on the module level might be beneficial. However, coping with softness requires fundamental rethinking the way modules are built. A major challenge is to develop a connection mechanism that does not limit the softness of the modules, does not require precise alignment and allows for easy detachment. In this paper, we propose a soft active connection mechanism based on electroadhesion. The mechanism uses electrostatic forces to connect modules. The method is easy to implement and can be integrated in a wide range of soft module types. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that the mechanism is suitable as a connection principle for light-weight modules when efficiency in a wide range of softness, tolerance to alignment and easy detachment are desired. The main contributions of this article are (i) the qualitative comparison of different connector principles for soft modular robots, (ii) the integration of electroadhesion, featuring a novel electrode pattern design, into soft modules, and (iii) the demonstration and characterization of the performance of functional soft module mockups including the connection mechanism.},

abstract = {Many standard robotic platforms are equipped with at least a fixed 2D laser range finder and a monocular camera. Although those platforms do not have sensors for 3D depth sensing capability, knowledge of depth is an essential part in many robotics activities. Therefore, recently, there is an increasing interest in depth estimation using monocular images. As this task is inherently ambiguous, the data-driven estimated depth might be unreliable in robotics applications. In this paper, we have attempted to improve the precision of monocular depth estimation by introducing 2D planar observation from the remaining laser range finder without extra cost. Specifically, we construct a dense reference map from the sparse laser range data, redefining the depth estimation task as estimating the distance between the real and the reference depth. To solve the problem, we construct a novel residual of residual neural network, and tightly combine the classification and regression losses for continuous depth estimation. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves considerable promotion compared to the state-of-the-art methods on both NYUD2 and KITTI, validating the effectiveness of our method on leveraging the additional sensory information. We further demonstrate the potential usage of our method in obstacle avoidance where our methodology provides comprehensive depth information compared to the solution using monocular camera or 2D laser range finder alone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carrying load alters normal walking, imposes additional stress to the musculoskeletal system, and results in an increase in energy consumption and a consequent earlier onset of fatigue. This phenomenon is largely due to increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking. METHODS: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO{\_}ON), unpowered (EXO{\_}OFF) and unpowered removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO{\_}OFF{\_}EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 {\%} their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics, kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface electromyography. RESULTS: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power in the EXO{\_}ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg(-1)) was 7.3 ± 5.0 {\%} and 14.2 ± 6.1 {\%} lower than in the EXO{\_}OFF{\_}EMR condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg(-1); p = 0.027) and in the EXO{\_}OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg(-1); p = 0.005), respectively. The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing the EXO{\_}ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg(-1)) with respect to the EXO{\_}OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg(-1); p = 0.020) and to the EXO{\_}OFF{\_}EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg(-1); p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve walking economy. These findings pave the way for future assistive devices that may enhance or restore gait in other applications.},

However, a great deal of this recent work has operated under the assumption that either the robot has complete knowledge of its environment or that its environment is suitably regular so as to be navigated with only minimal perception, an unrealistic assumption in many real-world domains. In this paper we present an integrated perception and control system for a quadruped robot that allows it to perceive and traverse previously unseen, rugged terrain that includes large, irregular obstacles. A key element of the system is a novel terrain modeling algorithm, used for filling in the occluded models resulting from on-board vision systems. We apply our approach to the LittleDog robot, and show that it allows the robot to walk over challenging terrain using only on-board perception.},

abstract = {PID control architectures are widely used in industrial applications. Despite their low number of open parameters, tuning multiple, coupled PID controllers can become tedious in practice. In this paper, we extend PILCO, a model-based policy search framework, to automatically tune multivariate PID controllers purely based on data observed on an otherwise unknown system. The system's state is extended appropriately to frame the PID policy as a static state feedback policy. This renders PID tuning possible as the solution of a finite horizon optimal control problem without further a priori knowledge. The framework is applied to the task of balancing an inverted pendulum on a seven degree-of-freedom robotic arm, thereby demonstrating its capabilities of fast and data-efficient policy learning, even on complex real world problems.},

abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

The single arm model is then expanded to a multiple arm system that is capable of generating archetypal locomotion patterns such as crawling and swimming. A hierarchical controller based on octopus neurophysiology is used to achieve simple and reliable control of the multiple continuum arm system. Simulations for single arm movements and multiple arm locomotions are presented. The results of this work can be used in the study of control schemes for multiple continuum arm robots and live octopuses. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) attached to the human waist support the body efficiently when the human is taking fatiguing postures, e.g. hunching over, squatting, or reaching the ceiling. Unlike a leg exoskeleton, where powered joints are attached to the human joints and are constrained to move together with the human limb, the SRL can take an arbitrary posture to maximize the load bearing efficiency. Taking a near-singular configuration, the SRL can bear a large load with small power consumption. First, the “bracing” strategy for supporting the human body is described, followed by a mathematical analysis of the load bearing efficiency. The optimal SRL posture and joint torques are then obtained in order to minimize the human load. Numerical and experimental results using a prototype of the SRL demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {We present the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), a wearable robot designed to assist human workers with additional arms and legs attached to the wearer's body. The SRL can work closely with the wearer by holding an object, positioning a workpiece, operating a powered tool, securing the human body, and more. Although the SRL has the potential to provide the wearer with greater strength, higher accuracy, flexibility, and dexterity, its control performance is hindered by unpredictable disturbances due to involuntary motions of the wearer, which include postural sway and physiological tremor. This paper presents 1) a Kalman filter approach to estimate the state of the SRL despite the involuntary wearer's motion, and 2) a method for improving the accuracy and stabilizing the human body and the SRL. The dynamics of the human-SRL system are analyzed, including human-induced disturbance models based on biomechanics literature. A discrete Kalman filter is constructed and its performance is evaluated in terms of error covariance. A 'bracing' technique is then introduced to suppress the human-induced disturbances; one robotic limb grasps an environment structure and uses it as a support to attenuate the disturbances. We show how bracing can be used to shape the stiffness parameters at the robot base. This in turn allows to enhance state estimation accuracy in the areas of the workspace where the user needs assistance. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

A dynamometer was used to measure grip strength and a pinch gauge to measure tip, key, and palmar pinch. A sample of 310 male and 328 female adults, ages 20 to 94, from the seven-county Milwaukee area were tested using standardized positioning and instructions. Right hand and left hand data were stratified into 12 age groups for both sexes. This stratification provides a means of comparing the score of individual patients to that of normal subjects of the same age and sex. The highest grip strength scores occurred in the 25 to 39 age groups. For tip, key, and palmar pinch the average scores were relatively stable from 20 to 59 years, with a gradual decline from 60 to 79 years. A high correlation was seen between grip strength and age, but a low to moderate correlation between pinch strength and age. The newer pinch gauge used in this study appears to read higher than that used in a previous normative study. Comparison of the average hand strength of right-handed and left-handed subjects showed only minimal differences.},

abstract = {Chronic hand impairment is common following stroke. While mass practice of movement has shown promise for rehabilitation, initial impairment of the hand may be too severe to permit even approximations of the desired movement. To facilitate movement, especially of pinch, we are building an exoskeleton to permit independent actuation of each of the three joints of the index finger. Separate actuators are used for flexion and extension, with closed-loop control of either force or position. In the future, a companion thumb exoskeleton will be developed to permit coordinated performance of pinch. This system will be used to assess strategies for optimizing rehabilitation of pinch and reach-to-pinch following stroke. The design of the actuated index finger exoskeleton is presented here.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of a multidisciplinary project where mechatronic engineers worked alongside biologists to develop a soft robotic arm that captures key features of octopus anatomy and neurophysiology. The concept of embodiment (the dynamic coupling between sensory-motor control, anatomy, materials and environment that allows for the animal to achieve adaptive behaviours) is used as a starting point for the design process but tempered by current engineering technologies and approaches. In this article, the embodied design requirements are first discussed from a robotic viewpoint by taking into account real-life engineering limitations; then, the motor control schemes inspired by octopus nervous system are investigated. Finally, the mechanical and control design of a prototype is presented that appropriately blends bio-inspiration and engineering limitations. Simulated and experimental results show that the devel-oped continuum robotic arm is able to reproduce octopus-like motions for bending, reaching and grasping.},

Their$\backslash$ndynamic nature yields unrivaled mobility, but serves to destabilize$\backslash$nthe motion estimation process that underlies legged operations.

abstract = {The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms mainly composed of muscles organized in a peculiar structure, named muscular hydrostat, that can change stiffness and that is used as a sort of a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology of the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tissues are such that the interaction with the environment, namely water, is exploited to simplify the control of movements. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a paradigmatic example of embodied intelligence and a good model for soft robotics. In this paper the design and the development of an artificial muscular hydrostat are reported, underling the efforts in the design and development of new technologies for soft robotics, like materials, mechanisms, soft actuators. The first prototype of soft robot arm is presented, with experimental results that show its capability to perform the basic movements of the octopus arm (like elongation, shortening, and bending) and demonstrate how embodiment can be effective in the design of robots.},

abstract = {Many interesting natural phenomena are sparsely distributed and discrete. Locating the hotspots of such sparsely distributed phenomena is often difficult because their density gradient is likely to be very noisy. We present a novel approach to this search problem, where we model the co-occurrence relations between a robot's observations with a Bayesian nonparametric topic model. This approach makes it possible to produce a robust estimate of the spatial distribution of the target, even in the absence of direct target observations. We apply the proposed approach to the problem of finding the spatial locations of the hotspots of a specific phytoplankton taxon in the ocean. We use classified image data from Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), which automatically measures individual microscopic cells and colonies of cells. Given these individual taxon-specific observations, we learn a phytoplankton community model that characterizes the co-occurrence relations between taxa. We present experiments with simulated robot missions drawn from real observation data collected during a research cruise traversing the US Atlantic coast. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms nearest neighbor and k-means based methods for predicting the spatial distribution of hotspots from in-situ observations.},

In this paper we present a model that is able to learn the complex mapping from raw 2D-laser range findings and a target position to the required steering commands for the robot. To our best knowledge, this work presents the first approach that learns a target-oriented end-to-end navigation model for a robotic platform. Furthermore, the supervised model training is based on expert demonstrations generated in simulation with an existing motion planner. We demonstrate that the learned navigation model is directly transferable to previously unseen virtual and, more interestingly, real-world environments. It can safely navigate the robot through obstacle-cluttered environments to reach the desired targets. We present an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the neural network-based motion planner, and compare it to a grid-based global approach, both in simulation and in real-world experiments.},

abstract = {A non-invasive, active neuro-vascular assessment system was developed using a modified temperature-controlled glove and feedback techniques. The glove incorporates local heating and cooling of the hand using multi-point skin temperature measurements as feedback, and thereby induces local and central mechanisms involved in thermoregulation. Electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and non-invasive finger-cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurements were used to monitor electrophysiology and hemodynamic changes in response to temperature modulation. Then, the triggered neuro-vascular mechanisms associated with thermoregulation were quantified by extracting parameters from the measured waveforms, specifically heart rate variability (HRV), vascular tone, and BP. The system was tested on six young, healthy individuals with no history of microvascular diseases. During heating, vasodilation, decrease in systolic BP, and a decrease in parasympathetic tone were observed, while during cooling, vasoconstriction and increased BP were observed. While such changes are expected physiologically using passive experiments, the ability to modulate the physiology non-invasively with a controlled, quantitative, and inexpensive instrument can potentially enable serial assessments of neuro-vascular control outside of clinical settings.},

The layer jamming mechanism is composed of multiple layers of thin Mylar film, and makes use of amplified friction between the films by applying vacuum pressure. In contrast to other tunable stiffness technology, such as particle jamming or field-activated materials (MR or ER fluids), layer jamming occupies a small volume and thus can be applied to small, light weight manipulators. The snake-like manipulator presented here is composed only of Mylar film and wires, and has highly flexible and under-actuated properties without application of a vacuum; however, it becomes highly stiff when a vacuum is applied. In this paper the characteristics of layer jamming are explored: its stiffness and breaking strength are obtained both theoretically and experimentally, and a prototype manipulator is developed and experimentally characterized.},

This paper describes the framework of a systems analysis project dealing with the above issues, which focuses on urban water and wastewater systems. The project is part of large national research program in Sweden entitled 'Sustainable Urban Water Management.' A set of sustainability criteria - covering health and hygiene, social and cultural aspects, environmental aspects, economy and technical considerations - are defined. To promote the practical use of a set of sustainability criteria it must be concise and related to quantifiable indicators that are easily measured. This paper suggests suitable indicators for the proposed criteria. It also contains a brief analysis of the contribution to various environmental effects and resource utilization of the Swedish urban water system in relation to the impact of Swedish society in total, to allow for a correct prioritization of the criteria.

abstract = {This paper examines the design and control of a robotic arm inspired by the anatomy and neurophysiology of Octopus vulgaris in light of embodiment theory. Embodiment in an animal is defined as the dynamic coupling between sensorymotor control, anatomy, materials, and the environment that allows for the animal to achieve effective behaviour. Octopuses in particular are highly embodied and dexterous animals: their arms are fully flexible, can bend in any direction, grasp objects and modulate stiffness along their length. In this paper the biomechanics and neurophysiology of octopus have been analysed to extract relevant information for use in the design and control of an embodied soft robotic arm. The embodied design requirements are firstly defined, and how the biology of the octopus meets these requirements presented. Next, a prototype continuum arm and control architecture based on octopus biology, and meeting the design criteria, are presented. Finally, experimental results are presented to show how the developed prototype arm is able to reproduce motions performed by live octopus for contraction, elongation, bending, and grasping.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a real-time classification scheme to cope with noisy Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements utilized in indoor positioning systems. RSSI values are often converted to distances for position estimation. However due to multipathing and shadowing effects, finding a unique sensor model using both parametric and non-parametric methods is highly challenging. We learn decision regions using the Gaussian Processes classification to accept measurements that are consistent with the operating sensor model. The proposed approach can perform online, does not rely on a particular sensor model or parameters, and is robust to sensor failures. The experimental results achieved using hardware show that available positioning algorithms can benefit from incorporating the classifier into their measurement model as a meta-sensor modeling technique.},

abstract = {Abstract According to Rivlin's Phenomenological Theory of Rubber Elasticity, the elastic properties of a rubber may be described in terms of a strain energy function which is an infinite power series in the strain invariants I1, I2 and I3. The simplest forms of Rivlin's strain energy function are the neo-Hookean, which is obtained by truncating the infinite series to just the first term in I1, and the Mooney-Rivlin, which retains the first terms in I1 and I2. Recently, we proposed a strain energy function which is a cubic in I1. Conceptually, the proposed function is a material model with a shear modulus that varies with deformation. In this paper, we compare the large strain behavior of rubber as predicted by these forms of the strain energy function. The elastic behavior of swollen rubber is also discussed.},

@article{Sun2012,
abstract = {Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering, vehicles for drug delivery, actuators for optics and fluidics, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels have achieved stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10 J m(-2) (ref. 8), as compared with ∼1,000 J m(-2) for cartilage and ∼10,000 J m(-2) for natural rubbers. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100-1,000 J m(-2) (refs 11, 14, 17). Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain ∼90{\%} water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of ∼9,000 J m(-2). Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.},

abstract = {This contribution is concerned with joint angle calculation based on inertial measurement data in the context of human motion analysis. Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°.},

Coated sensor gives a good stability, while woven sensor was relative less stable. Inelastic textile substrate reduces the hysteresis error caused by refraction and construction of materials. The sensitivities were between 2.5 to 9 vary with different sensors.

abstract = {Continuum robots are increasingly used in minimally invasive surgeries. To date, the concentric tube mechanism and the cable-driven mechanism have been two prevalent mechanisms for constructing continuum robots. As these two mechanisms complement each other, it is worth exploring the possibility of combining them together. In this paper, we investigate the dexterity of three continuum robots combining both mechanisms. Indices based on the concept of orientability are introduced to analyze the distribution of the dexterity. A Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the dexterity distribution across the workspace. Particularly, directional dexterity indices are put forward to describe the dexterity along different axes. Results imply that evenly allocating degrees of freedom (DOFs) among the segments achieves the best workspace and dexterity. Otherwise, assigning more DOFs to the proximal segment tends to enlarge the workspace and adding more DOFs to the distal segment tends to improve the dexterity. In addition, the dexterity along different axes can vary significantly and thus requires special attention when applying the robot to specific surgical procedures.},

In general, a combination of uniaxial tension (com- pression), biaxial tension, and simple shear is required for the characterisa- tion of an hyperelastic material. The experimental data was obtained by a uniaxial tension test and the material constants were determined by the least squares method. A comparison of hyperelastic material models is illustrated through an example of a rigid body in contact with a hyperelastic fabric in 3–D.},

abstract = {Synthetic systems cannot easily mimic the color-changing abilities of animals such as cephalopods. Soft machines--machines fabricated from soft polymers and flexible reinforcing sheets--are rapidly increasing in functionality. This manuscript describes simple microfluidic networks that can change the color, contrast, pattern, apparent shape, luminescence, and surface temperature of soft machines for camouflage and display. The color of these microfluidic networks can be changed simultaneously in the visible and infrared--a capability that organisms do not have. These strategies begin to imitate the functions, although not the anatomies, of color-changing animals.},

abstract = {Tensegrity robots, composed of rigid rods connected by elastic cables, have a number of unique properties that make them appealing for use as planetary exploration rovers. However, control of tensegrity robots remains a difficult problem due to their unusual structures and complex dynamics. In this work, we show how locomotion gaits can be learned automatically using a novel extension of mirror descent guided policy search (MDGPS) applied to periodic locomotion movements, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on tensegrity robot locomotion. We evaluate our method with real-world and simulated experiments on the SUPERball tensegrity robot, showing that the learned policies generalize to changes in system parameters, unreliable sensor measurements, and variation in environmental conditions, including varied terrains and a range of different gravities. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only learns fast, power-efficient feedback policies for rolling gaits, but that these policies can succeed with only the limited onboard sensing provided by SUPERball's accelerometers. We compare the learned feedback policies to learned open-loop policies and hand-engineered controllers, and demonstrate that the learned policy enables the first continuous, reliable locomotion gait for the real SUPERball robot.

abstract = {— The integration of minimally invasive robotic assistance and image-guidance can have positive impact on joint fracture surgery, providing a better clinical outcome with respect to the current open procedure. In this paper, a new design of the RAFS surgical system is presented. The redesign of the robotic system and its integration with a novel 3D navigation system through a new clinical workflow, overcomes the drawbacks of the earlier prototype. This makes the RAFS surgical system more suitable to clinical scenarios in the operating theatre. System accuracy and effectiveness are successfully demonstrated through laboratory trials and preliminary cadaveric trials. The experimental results demonstrate that the system allows the surgeon to reduce a 2-fragment distal femur fracture in a cadaveric specimen, with a reduction accuracy of up to 0.85 mm and 2.2°. Preliminary cadaveric trials also provided a positive and favorable outcome pointing to the usability and safety of the RAFS system in the operating theatre, potentially enhancing the capacity of joint fracture surgeries.},

Despite advances in sensing, in particular related to 3D video, the methodologies to process the data are still subject to research. We demonstrate superior results by a system which combines recurrent neural networks with convolutional neural networks in a voting approach. The gated-recurrent-unit-based neural networks are particularly well-suited to distinguish actions based on long-term information from optical tracking data; the 3D-CNNs focus more on detailed, recent information from video data. The resulting features are merged in an SVM which then classifies the movement. In this architecture, our method improves recognition rates of state-of-the-art methods by 14{\%} on standard data sets.},

@article{Tamar2016,
abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control method that has proved effective for robotics, among other fields. MPC performs re-planning at every time step. Re-planning is done with a limited horizon per computational and real-time constraints and often also for robustness to potential model errors. However, the limited horizon leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we consider the iterative learning setting, where the same task can be repeated several times, and propose a policy improvement scheme for MPC. The main idea is that between executions we can, offline, run MPC with a longer horizon, resulting in a hindsight plan. To bring the next real-world execution closer to the hindsight plan, our approach learns to re-shape the original cost function with the goal of satisfying the following property: short horizon planning (as realistic during real executions) with respect to the shaped cost should result in mimicking the hindsight plan. This effectively consolidates long-term reasoning into the short-horizon planning. We empirically evaluate our approach in contact-rich manipulation tasks both in simulated and real environments, such as peg insertion by a real PR2 robot.},

Animals exploit soft structures to move effectively in complex natural environments. These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. The goal is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural environments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The model is able to simulate spatial bending, pure elongation/contraction, and introduces inverse orientation kinematics for the first time to multisection continuum arms. Also, it carefully accounts for physical constraints in the joint space to provide enhanced insight into practical mechanics, and produces correct results for both forward and inverse kinematics. The model is validated through simulations, based on a prototype continuum robotic arm. Proposed approach is applicable to a broad spectrum of continuum robotic arm designs.},

abstract = {Bats have long captured the imaginations of scientists and engineers with their unrivaled agility and maneuvering characteristics, achieved by functionally versatile dynamic wing conformations as well as more than 40 active and passive joints on the wings. Wing flexibility and complex wing kinematics not only bring a unique perspective to research in biology and aerial robotics but also pose substantial technological challenges for robot modeling, design, and control. We have created a fully self-contained, autonomous flying robot that weighs 93 grams, called Bat Bot (B2), to mimic such morphological properties of bat wings. Instead of using a large number of distributed control actuators, we implement highly stretchable silicone-based membrane wings that are controlled at a reduced number of dominant wing joints to best match the morphological characteristics of bat flight. First, the dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the bat flight mechanism are identified and incorporated in B2{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s design by means of a series of mechanical constraints. These biologically meaningful DOFs include asynchronous and mediolateral movements of the armwings and dorsoventral movements of the legs. Second, the continuous surface and elastic properties of bat skin under wing morphing are realized by an ultrathin (56 micrometers) membranous skin that covers the skeleton of the morphing wings. We have successfully achieved autonomous flight of B2 using a series of virtual constraints to control the articulated, morphing wings.},

abstract = {Weed scouting is an important part of modern integrated weed management but can be time consuming and sparse when performed manually. Automated weed scouting and weed destruction has typically been performed using classification systems able to classify a set group of species known a priori. This greatly limits deployability as classification systems must be retrained for any field with a different set of weed species present within them. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper works towards developing a clustering approach to weed scouting which can be utilized in any field without the need for prior species knowledge. We demonstrate our system using challenging data collected in the field from an agricultural robotics platform. We show that considerable improvements can be made by (i) learning low-dimensional (bottleneck) features using a deep convolutional neural network to represent plants in general and (ii) tying views of the same area (plant) together. Deploying this algorithm on in-field data collected by AgBotII, we are able to successfully cluster cotton plants from grasses without prior knowledge or training for the specific plants in the field.},

abstract = {Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) that operate in unstructured, unexplored environments require fast and flexible local planning, which can replan when new parts of the map are explored. Trajectory optimization methods fulfill these needs, but require obstacle distance information, which can be given by Euclidean Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs). We propose a method to incrementally build ESDFs from Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDFs), a common implicit surface representation used in computer graphics and vision. TSDFs are fast to build and smooth out sensor noise over many observations, and are designed to produce surface meshes. Meshes allow human operators to get a better assessment of the robot's environment, and set high-level mission goals. We show that we can build TSDFs faster than Octomaps, and that it is more accurate to build ESDFs out of TSDFs than occupancy maps. Our complete system, called voxblox, will be available as open source and runs in real-time on a single CPU core. We validate our approach on-board an MAV, by using our system with a trajectory optimization local planner, entirely on-board and in real-time.},

abstract = {— Fetching items is an important problem for a social robot. It requires a robot to interpret a person's language and gesture and use these noisy observations to infer what item to deliver. If the robot could ask questions, it would help the robot be faster and more accurate in its task. Existing approaches either do not ask questions, or rely on fixed question-asking policies. To address this problem, we propose a model that makes assumptions about cooperation between agents to perform richer signal extraction from observations. This work defines a mathematical framework for an item-fetching domain that allows a robot to increase the speed and accuracy of its ability to interpret a person's requests by reasoning about its own uncertainty as well as processing implicit information (implicatures). We formalize the item-delivery domain as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and approximately solve this POMDP in real time. Our model improves speed and accuracy of fetching tasks by asking relevant clarifying questions only when necessary. To measure our model's improvements, we conducted a real world user study with 16 participants. Our method achieved greater accuracy and a faster interaction time compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our model is 2.17 seconds faster (25{\%} faster) than a state-of-the-art baseline, while being 2.1{\%} more accurate.},

abstract = {In recent years, dielectric elastomers have received increasing attention due to their unparalleled large strain actuation response ({\textgreater}100{\%}). The force output, however, has remained a major limiting factor for many applications. To address this limitation, a model for a fiber reinforced dielectric elastomer actuator based on the deformation mechanism of McKibben actuators is presented. In this novel configuration, the outer cylindrical surface of a dielectric elastomer is enclosed by a network of helical fibers that are thin, flexible and inextensible. This configuration yields an axially contractile actuator, in contrast to unreinforced actuators which extend. The role of the fiber network is twofold: (i) to serve as reinforcement to improve the load-bearing capability of dielectric elastomers, and (ii) to render the actuator inextensible in the axial direction such that the only free deformation path is simultaneous radial expansion and axial contraction. In this paper, a mathematical model of the electromechanical response of fiber reinforced dielectric elastomers is derived. The model is developed within a continuum mechanics framework for large deformations. The cylindrical electro-pneumatic actuator is modeled by adapting Green and Adkins' theory of reinforced cylinders to account for the applied electric field. Using this approach, numerical solutions are obtained assuming a Mooney-Rivlin material model. The results indicate that the relationship between the contractile force and axial shortening is bilinear within the voltage range considered. The characteristic response as a function of various system parameters such as the fiber angle, inflation pressure, and the applied voltage are reported. In this paper, the elastic portion of the modeling approach is validated using experimental data for McKibben actuators. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents the complete development and analysis of a soft robotic platform that exhibits peristaltic locomotion. The design principle is based on the antagonistic arrangement of circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaetes. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure using a nickel titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around the circumference. An enhanced theoretical model of the NiTi coil spring describes the combination of martensite deformation and spring elasticity as a function of geometry. A numerical model of the mesh structures reveals how peristaltic actuation induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of circumferential NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of speed. Utilizing additional NiTi coils placed longitudinally, steering capabilities are incorporated. Proprioceptive potentiometers sense segment contraction, which enables the development of closed-loop controllers. Several appropriate control algorithms are designed and experimentally compared based on locomotion speed and energy consumption. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impact during operation. This approach allows a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources.},

abstract = {The provision of continuous passive, and intent-based assisted movements for neuromuscular training can be incorporated into a robotic elbow sleeve. The objective of this study is to propose the design and test the functionality of a soft robotic elbow sleeve in assisting flexion and extension of the elbow, both passively and using intent-based motion reinforcement. First, the elbow sleeve was developed, using elastomeric and fabric-based pneumatic actuators, which are soft and lightweight, in order to address issues of non-portability and poor alignment with joints that conventional robotic rehabilitation devices are faced with. Second, the control system was developed to allow for: (i) continuous passive actuation, in which the actuators will be activated in cycles, alternating between flexion and extension; and (ii) an intent-based actuation, in which user intent is detected by surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors attached to the biceps and triceps, and passed through a logic sequence to allow for flexion or extension of the elbow. Using this setup, the elbow sleeve was tested on six healthy subjects to assess the functionality of the device, in terms of the range of motion afforded by the device while in the continuous passive actuation. The results showed that the elbow sleeve is capable of achieving approximately 50{\%} of the full range of motion of the elbow joint among all subjects. Next, further experiments were conducted to test the efficacy of the intent-based actuation on these healthy subjects. The results showed that all subjects were capable of achieving electromyography (EMG) control of the elbow sleeve. These preliminary results show that the elbow sleeve is capable of carrying out continuous passive and intent-based assisted movements. Further investigation of the clinical implementation of the elbow sleeve for the neuromuscular training of neurologically-impaired persons, such as stroke survivors, is needed.},

Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots offers students and other interested readers an overview of the technology of mobilitythe mechanisms that allow a mobile robot to move through a real world environment to perform its tasksincluding locomotion, sensing, localization, and motion planning. It discusses all facets of mobile robotics, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, and robot control architectures.The design of any successful robot involves the integration of many different disciplines, among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. Reflecting this, the book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter covers a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. The first two chapters explore low-level locomotory ability, examining robots' wheels and legs and the principles of kinematics. This is followed by an in-depth view of perception, including descriptions of many "off-the-shelf" sensors and an analysis of the interpretation of sensed data. The final two chapters consider the higher-level challenges of localization and cognition, discussing successful localization strategies, autonomous mapping, and navigation competence. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook for coursework or a working tool for beginners in the field.},

abstract = {Two less addressed issues of deep reinforcement learning are (1) lack of generalization capability to new target goals, and (2) data inefficiency i.e., the model requires several (and often costly) episodes of trial and error to converge, which makes it impractical to be applied to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address these two issues and apply our model to the task of target-driven visual navigation. To address the first issue, we propose an actor-critic model whose policy is a function of the goal as well as the current state, which allows to better generalize. To address the second issue, we propose AI2-THOR framework, which provides an environment with high-quality 3D scenes and physics engine. Our framework enables agents to take actions and interact with objects. Hence, we can collect a huge number of training samples efficiently. We show that our proposed method (1) converges faster than the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, (2) generalizes across targets and across scenes, (3) generalizes to a real robot scenario with a small amount of fine-tuning (although the model is trained in simulation), (4) is end-to-end trainable and does not need feature engineering, feature matching between frames or 3D reconstruction of the environment.

abstract = {We demonstrate that field-responsive magnetorheological fluids can be used for variable-strength controllable adhesion. The adhesive performance is measured experimentally in tensile tests (a.k.a. probe-tack experiments) in which the magnetic field is provided by a cylindrical permanent magnet. Increasing the magnetic field strength induces higher peak adhesive forces. We hypothesize that the adhesion mechanism arises from the shear resistance of a yield stress fluid in a thin gap. This hypothesis is supported by comparing the experimentally measured adhesive performance to the response predicted by a lubrication model for a non-Newtonian fluid with a field-dependent yield stress. The model predictions are in agreement with experimental data up to moderate field strengths. Above a critical magnetic field strength the model over-predicts the experimentally measured values indicating non-ideal conditions such as local fluid dewetting from the surface.},

abstract = {A number of robotic studies have recently turned to biological inspiration in designing control schemes for flexible robots. Examples of such robots include continuous manipulators inspired by the octopus arm. However, the control strategies used by an octopus in moving its arms are still not fully understood. Starting from a dynamic model of an octopus arm and a given set of muscle activations, we develop a simulation technique to characterize the stiffness throughout a motion and at multiple points along the arm. By applying this technique to reaching and bending motions, we gain a number of insights that can help a control engineer design a biologically inspired impedance control scheme for a flexible robot arm. The framework developed is a general one that can be applied to any motion for any dynamic model. We also propose a theoretical analysis to efficiently estimate the stiffness analytically given a set of muscle activations. This analysis can be used to quickly evaluate the stiffness for new static configurations and dynamic movements.},

abstract = {The octopus arm is an outstanding example of an efficient boneless and highly flexible appendage. We have begun characterizing the neuromuscular system of the octopus arm in both innervated muscle preparations and dissociated muscle cells. Functionally antagonistic longitudinal and transverse muscle fibers showed no differences in membrane properties and mode of innervation. The muscle cells are excitable but have a broad range of linear membrane properties. They are electrotonically very compact so that localized synaptic inputs can control the membrane potential of the entire muscle cell. Three distinct excitatory neuronal inputs to each arm muscle cell were identified; their reversal potentials were extrapolated to be about -10 mV. These appear to be cholinergic as they are blocked by hexamethonium, D-tubocurarine, and atropine. Two inputs have low quantal amplitude (1-7 mV) and slow rise times (4-15 ms), whereas the third has a large size (5-25 mV) and fast rise time (2-4 ms). This large synaptic input is most likely due to exceptionally large quantal events. The probability of release is rather low, suggesting a stochastic activation of muscle cells. All inputs demonstrated a modest activity-dependent plasticity typical of fast neuromuscular systems. The pre- and postsynaptic properties suggest a rather direct relation between neuronal activity and muscle action. The lack of significant electrical coupling between muscle fibers and the indications for the small size of the motor units suggest that the neuromuscular system of the octopus arm has evolved to ensure a high level of precise localization in the neural control of arm function.},

abstract = {— Aerial-Aquatic locomotion would allow a broad array of tasks in robot enabled environmental monitoring or disaster management. One of the most significant challenges of aerial-aquatic locomotion in mobile robots is finding a propulsion system that is capable of working effectively in both fluids, and transitioning between them. The large differences in density and viscosity in air compared to water means that a single direct propulsion system without adaptability will be inefficient in at least one medium. This paper examines multimodal propeller propulsion using computational tools validated against experimental data. Based on this analysis we present a novel gearbox enabling an aerial propulsion system to operate efficiently underwater. This achieved with minimal complexity using a single fixed pitch propeller, which can change gear underwater by reversing the drive motor, but with the gearing arranged to leave the propeller direction unchanged. This system is then integrated into a small robot, and flights in air and locomotion underwater are demonstrated.},

Such algorithms can be readily implemented for traditional rigid robots, but remain a challenge for nonlinear and low-bandwidth soft robotic systems. This article addresses the theoretical modeling of the dynamics of a pressure-operated soft snake robot. A general framework is detailed to solve the 2D modeling problem of a soft snake robot, which is applicable to most pressure-operated soft robots developed by a modular kinematic arrangement of bending-type fluidic elastomer actuators. The model is simulated using measured physical parameters of a soft snake robot prototype. The theoretical results are verified through a detailed comparison to locomotion experiments on a flat surface with measured frictional properties. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model describes the motion of the robot accurately.},

We propose a hybrid control strategy that guarantees the accomplishment of each agent's local goal specification, which is given as a temporal logic formula, while guaranteeing inter-agent collision avoidance. In particular, by defining 3-D spheres that bound the agents' volume, we extend previous work on decentralized navigation functions and propose control laws that navigate the agents among predefined regions of interest of the workspace while avoiding collision with each other. This allows us to abstract the motion of the agents as finite transition systems and, by employing standard formal verification techniques, to derive a high-level control algorithm that satisfies the agents' specifications. Simulation and experimental results with quadrotors verify the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The basic concepts for exoskeletal systems have been suggested for some time with applications ranging from construction, manufacturing and mining to rescue and emer- gency services. In recent years, research has been driven by possible uses in medi- cal/rehabilitation and military applications. Yet there are still significant barriers to the effective use and exploitation of this technology. Among the most pertinent of these factors is the power and actuation system and its impact of control, strength, speed and, perhaps most critically, safety. This work describes the design, construction and test- ing of an ultra low-mass, full-body exoskeleton system having seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the upper limbs and five degrees of freedom (DOFs) for each of the lower limbs. This low mass is primarily due to the use of a new range of pneumatic muscle actuators as the power source for the system. The work presented will show how the system takes advantage of the inherent controllable compliance to produce a unit that is powerful, providing a wide range of functionality (motion and forces over an extended range) in a manner that has high safety integrity for the user. The general layout of both the upper and the lower body exoskeleton is presented together with results from preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of the device in limb retraining, rehabilitation and power assist (augmentation) operations.},

abstract = {Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a disease which attacks the synovial tissue lubricating skeletal joints. This systemic condition affects the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, muscles and tendons that contribute to loss of function and Range of Motion (ROM). Traditional measurement of arthritis requires labour intensive personal examination by medical staff which through their objective measures may hinder the enactment and analysis of arthritis rehabilitation. This paper presents the development of a smart glove to facilitate this rehabilitative process through the integration of sensors, processors and wireless technology to empirically measure ROM. The Tyndall/University of Ulster glove uses a combination of 20 bend sensors, 16 tri-axial accelerometers and 11 force sensors to detect joint movement. All sensors are placed on a flexible PCB to provide high levels of flexibility and sensor stability. The system operation means that the glove does not require calibration for each glove wearer.},

abstract = {Different approaches are available to compensate gait in persons with spinal cord injury, including passive orthoses, functional electrical stimulation (FES), and robotic exoskeletons. However, several drawbacks arise from each specific approach. Orthotic gait is energy-demanding for the user and functionally ineffective. FES uses the muscles as natural actuators to generate gait, providing not only functional but also psychological benefits to the users. However, disadvantages are also related to the early appearance of muscle fatigue and the control of joint trajectories. Robotic exoskeletons that provide joint moment compensation or substitution to the body during walking have been developed in recent years. Significant advances have been achieved, but the technology itself is not mature yet because of many limitations related to both physical and cognitive interaction as well as portability and energy-management issues. Meanwhile, the combination of FES technology and exoskeletons has emerged as a promising approach to both gait compensation and rehabilitation, bringing together technologies, methods, and rehabilitation principles that can overcome the drawbacks of each individual approach. This article presents an overview of hybrid lower-limb exoskeletons, related technologies, and advances in actuation and control systems. Also, we highlight the functional assessment of individuals with spinal cord injury.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robust and efficient semi-dense visual odometry solution for RGB-D cameras. The core of our method is a 2D-3D ICP pipeline which estimates the pose of the sensor by registering the projection of a 3D semi-dense map of the reference frame with the 2D semi-dense region extracted in the current frame. The processing is speeded up by efficiently implemented approximate nearest neighbour fields under the Euclidean distance criterion, which permits the use of compact Gauss-Newton updates in the optimization. The registration is formulated as a maximum a posterior problem to deal with outliers and sensor noises, and consequently the equivalent weighted least squares problem is solved by iteratively reweighted least squares method. A variety of robust weight functions are tested and the optimum is determined based on the characteristics of the sensor model. Extensive evaluation on publicly available RGB-D datasets shows that the proposed method predominantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Bayesian Optimisation has gained much popularity lately, as a global optimisation technique for functions that are expensive to evaluate or unknown a priori. While classical BO focuses on where to gather an observation next, it does not take into account practical constraints for a robotic system such as where it is physically possible to gather samples from, nor the sequential nature of the problem while executing a trajectory. In field robotics and other real-life situations, physical and trajectory constraints are inherent problems. This paper addresses these issues by formulating Bayesian Optimisation for continuous trajectories within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. The resulting POMDP is solved using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which we adapt to using a reward function balancing exploration and exploitation. Experiments on monitoring a spatial phenomenon with a UAV illustrate how our BO-POMDP algorithm outperforms competing techniques.},

abstract = {— Transport of objects is a major application in robotics nowadays. While ground robots can carry heavy payloads for long distances, they are limited in rugged terrains. Aerial robots can deliver objects in arbitrary terrains; however they tend to be limited in payload. It has been previously shown that, for heavy payloads, it can be beneficial to carry them using multiple flying robots. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative transport scheme, in which two quadrotors trans-port a cable-suspended payload at accelerations that exceed the capabilities of previous collaborative approaches, which make quasi-static assumptions. Furthermore, this is achieved completely without explicit communication between the collab-orating robots, making our system robust to communication failures and making consensus on a common reference frame unnecessary. Instead, they only rely on visual and inertial cues obtained from on-board sensors. We implement and validate the proposed method on a real system.},

However, does human performance improve with three hands compared to two hands? To evaluate this possibility, we carried out a behavioural study on the performance of naive adults catching objects with three virtual hands controlled by their two hands and right foot. The subjects could successfully control the virtual hands in a few trials. With this control strategy, the workspace of the hands was inversely correlated with the task velocity. The comparison of performance between the three and two hands control revealed no significant difference of success in catching falling objects and in average effort during the tasks. Subjects preferred the three handed control strategy, found it easier, with less physical and mental burden. Although the coordination of the foot with the natural hands increased trial after trial, about two minutes of practice was not sufficient to develop a sense of ownership towards the third arm.},

abstract = {The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms composed of a pe-culiar muscular structure, named a muscular hydrostat. The octopus arms provide it with both locomotion and grasping capabilities, thanks to the fact that their stiffness can change over a wide range and can be controlled through combined contractions of the muscles. The muscular hydrostat can better be seen as a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tis-sues are such that the interaction with the environment (i.e., water) is exploited to simplify control. Thanks to this effective mechanism of embodied intelligence, the octopus can control a very high number of degrees of freedom, with relatively limited computing resources. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a good model for embodied intelligence and for soft robotics. The prototype of a robot arm has been built based on an artificial muscular hydrostat inspired to the muscular hydrostat of the Octopus vulgaris. The prototype presents the morphology of the biological model and the broad arrangement of longitudinal and transverse muscles. Actuation is obtained with cables (longitudinally) and with shape memory alloy springs (transversally). The robot arm combines contractions and it can show the basic movements of the octopus arm, like elongation, shortening and bending, in water.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study extensions to the Gaussian Processes (GPs) continuous occupancy mapping problem. There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems that we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map inference. We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robot's perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the map quality.},

abstract = {— In this work, we develop a novel keyframe-based dense planar SLAM (KDP-SLAM) system, based on CPU only, to reconstruct large indoor environments in real-time using a hand-held RGB-D sensor. Our keyframe-based approach applies a fast dense method to estimate odometry, fuses depth measurements from small baseline images, extracts planes from the fused depth map, and optimizes the poses of the keyframes and landmark planes in a global factor graph using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM). Using the fast odometry estimation, correct plane correspondences may be found projectively, and the pose of each frame can be estimated accurately even without sufficient planes to fully constrain the 6 degree-of-freedom transformation. The depth map gener-ated from the local fusion process generates higher quality reconstructions and plane segmentations by eliminating noise. Moreover, explicitly modeling plane landmarks in the fully probabilistic global optimization significantly reduces the drift that plagues other dense SLAM algorithms. We test our system on standard RGB-D benchmarks as well as additional indoor environments, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance as a real-time dense 3D SLAM algorithm, without the use of GPU.},

abstract = {We study the nonlinear observability of a systems states in view of how well they are observable and what control inputs would improve the convergence of their estimates. We use these insights to develop an observability-aware trajectory-optimization framework for nonlinear systems that produces trajectories well suited for self-calibration. Common trajectory-planning algorithms tend to generate motions that lead to an unobservable subspace of the system state, causing suboptimal state estimation. We address this problem with a method that reasons about the quality of observability while respecting system dynamics and motion constraints to yield the optimal trajectory for rapid convergence of the self-calibration states (or other user-chosen states). Experiments performed on a simulated quadrotor system with a GPS-IMU sensor suite demonstrate the benefits of the optimized observability-aware trajectories when compared to a covariance-based approach and multiple heuristic approaches. Our method is approx. 80x faster than the covariance-based approach and achieves better results than any other approach in the self-calibration task. We applied our method to a waypoint navigation task and achieved a approx. 2x improvement in the integrated RMSE of the global position estimates and approx. 4x improvement in the integrated RMSE of the GPS-IMU transformation estimates compared to a minimal-energy trajectory planner.},

Distinguishing which laser points measure the checkerboard and which lie on the background is essential to any such system. We formulate the checkerboard extraction as a combinatorial optimization problem with a clear cut objective function. We propose a branch-and-bound technique that deterministically and globally optimizes the objective. Unlike what is available in the literature, the proposed method is not heuristic and does not require assumptions such as constraints on the background or relying on discontinuity of the range measurements to partition the data into line segments. The proposed approach is generic and can be applied to both 3D or 2D laser scanners as well as the cases where multiple checkerboards are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by providing numerical simulations as well as experimental results.},

The algorithm combines the mathematical programming based on the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique and the finite element technique based on the Integrated Force Method. A new approach based on the single value decomposition technique has been developed to derive the compatibility matrix required in the force method. Benchmark case studies illustrate the procedure and allow the results obtained to be compared with those reported in the literature. It is shown that the computational effort required by the force method is significantly lower than that of the displacement method and in some cases such as structural optimization problems with multiple frequency constraints, the analysis procedure (force or displacement method) significantly affects the final optimum design and the structural optimization based on the force method may result in a lighter design. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Soft robotics is a current focus in robotics research because of the expected capability of soft robots to better interact with real-world environments. As a point of inspiration in the development of innovative technologies in soft robotics, octopuses are particularly interesting 'animal models'. Octopus arms have unique biomechanical capabilities that combine significant pliability with the ability to exert a great deal of force, because they lack rigid structures but can change and control their degree of stiffness. The octopus arm motor capability is a result of the peculiar arrangement of its muscles and the properties of its tissues. These special abilities have been investigated by the authors in a specific study dedicated to identifying the key principles underlying these biological functions and deriving engineering requirements for robotics solutions. This paper, which is the second in a two-part series, presents how the identified requirements can be used to create innovative technological solutions, such as soft materials, mechanisms and actuators. Experiments indicate the ability of these proposed solutions to ensure the same performance as in the biological model in terms of compliance, elongation and force. These results represent useful and relevant components of innovative soft-robotic systems and suggest their potential use to create a new generation of highly dexterous, soft-bodied robots.},

abstract = {— This work introduces a novel hybrid control architecture for a hexapod platform (Weaver), making it capable of autonomously navigating in uneven terrain. The main contribution stems from the use of vision-based exte-roceptive terrain perception to adapt the robot's locomotion parameters. Avoiding computationally expensive path planning for the individual foot tips, the adaptation controller enables the robot to reactively adapt to the surface structure it is moving on. The virtual stiffness, which mainly characterizes the behavior of the legs' impedance controller is adapted according to visually perceived terrain properties. To further improve locomotion, the frequency and height of the robot's stride are similarly adapted. Furthermore, novel methods for terrain characterization and a keyframe based visual-inertial odometry algorithm are combined to generate a spatial map of terrain characteristics. Localization via odometry also allows for autonomous missions on variable terrain by incorporating global navigation and terrain adaptation into one control architecture. Autonomous runs on a testbed with variable terrain types illustrate that adaptive stride and impedance behavior decreases the cost of transport by 30 {\%} compared to a non-adaptive approach and simultaneously increases body stability (up to 88 {\%} on even terrain and by 54 {\%} on uneven terrain). Weaver is able to freely explore outdoor environments as it is completely free of external tethers, as shown in the experiments.},

abstract = {We introduce SE3-Nets, which are deep neural networks designed to model and learn rigid body motion from raw point cloud data. Based only on sequences of depth images along with action vectors and point wise data associations, SE3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-Nets predict SE3 transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-Nets enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-Nets also work well on real data.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the continuous six degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose (3D translation and rotation) of an object from a single RGB image. The approach combines semantic keypoints predicted by a convolutional network (convnet) with a deformable shape model. Unlike prior work, we are agnostic to whether the object is textured or textureless, as the convnet learns the optimal representation from the available training image data. Furthermore, the approach can be applied to instance- and class-based pose recovery. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach can accurately recover the 6-DoF object pose for both instance- and class-based scenarios with a cluttered background. For class-based object pose estimation, state-of-the-art accuracy is shown on the large-scale PASCAL3D+ dataset.},

@article{Godage2016,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel spatial kinematic model for multisection continuum arms based on mode shape functions (MSF). Modal methods have been used in many disciplines from finite element methods to structural analysis to approximate complex and nonlinear parametric variations with simple mathematical functions. Given certain constraints and required accuracy, this helps to simplify complex phenomena with numerically efficient implementations leading to fast computations. A successful application of the modal approximation techniques to develop a new modal kinematic model for general variable length multisection continuum arms is discussed. The proposed method solves the limitations associated with previous models and introduces a new approach for readily deriving exact, singularity-free and unique MSF's that simplifies the approach and avoids mode switching. The model is able to simulate spatial bending as well as straight arm motions (i.e., pure elongation/contraction), and introduces inverse position and orientation kinematics for multisection continuum arms. A kinematic decoupling feature, splitting position and orientation inverse kinematics is introduced. This type of decoupling has not been presented for these types of robotic arms before. The model also carefully accounts for physical constraints in the joint space to provide enhanced insight into practical mechanics and impose actuator mechanical limitations onto the kinematics thus generating fully realizable results. The proposed method is easily applicable to a broad spectrum of continuum arm designs.},

@article{Favre2006,
abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop an ambulatory system for the three-dimensional (3D) knee kinematics evaluation, which can be used outside a laboratory during long-term monitoring. In order to show the efficacy of this ambulatory system, knee function was analysed using this system, after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lesion, and after reconstructive surgery. The proposed system was composed of two 3D gyroscopes, fixed on the shank and on the thigh, and a portable data logger for signal recording. The measured parameters were the 3D mean range of motion (ROM) and the healthy knee was used as control. The precision of this system was first assessed using an ultrasound reference system. The repeatability was also estimated. A clinical study was then performed on five unilateral ACL-deficient men (range: 19-36 years) prior to, and a year after the surgery. The patients were evaluated with the IKDC score and the kinematics measurements were carried out on a 30 m walking trial. The precision in comparison with the reference system was 4.4 degrees , 2.7 degrees and 4.2 degrees for flexion-extension, internal-external rotation, and abduction-adduction, respectively. The repeatability of the results for the three directions was 0.8 degrees , 0.7 degrees and 1.8 degrees . The averaged ROM of the five patients' healthy knee were 70.1 degrees (standard deviation (SD) 5.8 degrees), 24.0 degrees (SD 3.0 degrees) and 12.0 degrees (SD 6.3 degrees for flexion-extension, internal-external rotation and abduction-adduction before surgery, and 76.5 degrees (SD 4.1 degrees), 21.7 degrees (SD 4.9 degrees) and 10.2 degrees (SD 4.6 degrees) 1 year following the reconstruction. The results for the pathologic knee were 64.5 degrees (SD 6.9 degrees), 20.6 degrees (SD 4.0 degrees) and 19.7 degrees (8.2 degrees) during the first evaluation, and 72.3 degrees (SD 2.4 degrees), 25.8 degrees (SD 6.4 degrees) and 12.4 degrees (SD 2.3 degrees) during the second one. The performance of the system enabled us to detect knee function modifications in the sagittal and transverse plane. Prior to the reconstruction, the ROM of the injured knee was lower in flexion-extension and internal-external rotation in comparison with the controlateral knee. One year after the surgery, four patients were classified normal (A) and one almost normal (B), according to the IKDC score, and changes in the kinematics of the five patients remained: lower flexion-extension ROM and higher internal-external rotation ROM in comparison with the controlateral knee. The 3D kinematics was changed after an ACL lesion and remained altered one year after the surgery.},

Note that we can easily rewrite this fixed-point problem as a root-finding problem by setting f (x) = x − g(x) and likewise we can recast the root-finding prob-lem into a fixed-point problem by setting g(x) = f (x) − x. Often it will not be possible to solve such nonlinear equation root-finding problems an-alytically. When this occurs we turn to numerical methods to approximate the solution. The methods employed are usually iterative. Generally speaking, algorithms for solving problems numerically can be divided into two main groups: direct methods and iterative methods. Direct methods are those which can be completed in a predetermined finite num-ber of steps. Iterative methods are methods which converge to the solution over time. These algorithms run until some convergence criterion is met. When choosing which method to use one important consideration is how quickly the algorithm converges to the solution or the method's convergence rate.},

abstract = {Measurement of ground contact forces (GCFs) provides necessary information to detect human gait phases. In this paper, a new analysis method of the GCF signals is discussed for detection of the gait phases. Human gaits are complicated, and the gait phases cannot be exactly distinguished by comparing sensor outputs to a threshold. This paper proposes a method by fuzzy logic for detecting the gait phases continuously and smoothly. The smooth and continuous detection of the gait phases enables a full use of information obtained from GCF sensors. For advanced rehabilitation systems, this paper also introduces a higher level algorithm that quantitatively monitors the amount of abnormalities in a human gait. The abnormalities detected by the proposed method include an improper GCF pattern as well as an incorrect sequence of the gait phases. To realize the monitoring algorithm, the gait phases are analyzed as a vector and the abnormalities are detected by simple kinematic equations. The proposed methods are implemented by using signals from sensor-embedded shoes called smart shoes. Each smart shoe has four GCF sensors installed between the cushion pad and the sole. The GCF sensor applies an air pressure sensor connected to an air bladder. A gait monitoring system that integrates the proposed methods is shown in this paper and verified for both normal and abnormal gaits.},

We create a tangible deformable device that allows users to “touch” soft tissues and perceive mechanical material properties, in a realistic manner. The device is able to dynamically provide user touch with different stiffness perceptions, thanks to actuators placed at the boundaries. We introduce a control algorithm, based on inverse Finite Element Analysis, which controls the actuators in order to recreate a desired stiffness that corresponds to the contact with soft tissues in the virtual environment. The approach uses antagonistic actuation principle to create a wide range of stiffness. We validate our algorithm and demonstrate the method using prototypes based on simple mechanisms.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for collision-free global navigation for continuous-time multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics. Our approach is general and can be used to perform collision-free navigation in 2D and 3D workspaces with narrow passages and crowded regions. As part of pre-computation, we compute multiple bridges in the narrow or tight regions in the workspace using kinodynamic RRT algorithms. Our bridge has certain geometric characteristics, that en- able us to calculate a collision-free trajectory for each agent using simple interpolation at runtime. Moreover, we combine interpolated bridge trajectories with local multi-agent navigation algorithms to compute global collision-free paths for each agent. The overall approach combines the performance benefits of coupled multi-agent algorithms with the pre- computed trajectories of the bridges to handle challenging scenarios. In practice, our approach can handle tens to hundreds of agents in real-time on a single CPU core in 2D and 3D workspaces.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of finding grasp contacts that are optimal under a given grasp quality function on arbitrary objects. Our approach formulates a framework for contact-level grasping as a path finding problem in the space of super-contact grasps. The initial super-contact grasp contains all grasps and in each step along a path grasps are removed. For this, we introduce and formally characterize search space structure and cost functions under which minimal cost paths correspond to optimal grasps. Our formulation avoids expensive exhaustive search and reduces computational cost by several orders of magnitude. We present admissible heuristic functions and exploit approximate heuristic search to further reduce computational cost while maintaining bounded sub-optimality for resulting grasps. We exemplify our formulation with point-contact grasping for which we define domain specific heuristics and demonstrate optimality and bounded sub-optimality by comparing against exhaustive and uniform cost search on example objects. Furthermore, we explain how to restrict the search graph to satisfy grasp constraints for modeling hand kinematics. We also analyze our algorithm empirically in terms of created and visited search states and resultant effective branching factor.},

The soft surface was fabricated from a deformable rubber bag filled with incompressible fluid and a microgripper inside the fluid. A ratchet was installed at the underactuated joint so that the joint's rotation caused by contact with an environment, such as a supporting surface, can be preserved, and the actions of scooping and enveloping an object are realized. With one actuator, the gripper realized three modes i.e., parallel gripper, pinching, and enveloping. The range of graspable objects was wide and included soft, rigid, deformable, fragile, small (boundary length less than 30 mm), large (more than 80 mm long), thin (less than 0.5 mm) and heavy (more than 3 kg) objects.},

We introduce a Parallel Autonomy shared-control framework that produces safe trajectories based on human inputs even in much more complex driving scenarios, such as those commonly encountered in an urban setting. We minimize the deviation from the human inputs while ensuring safety via a set of collision avoidance constraints. We develop a receding horizon planner formulated as a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) including analytic descriptions of road boundaries, and the configurations and future uncertainties of other traffic participants, and directly supplying them to the optimizer without linearization. The NMPC operates over both steering and acceleration simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed receding horizon planner also applies to fully autonomous ve-hicles. We validate the proposed approach through simulations in a wide variety of complex driving scenarios such as left-turns across traffic, passing on busy streets, and under dynamic constraints in sharp turns on a race track.},

Mimicking some features of the octopus is instrumental to design a dexterous and compliant system. After analysing the relevant anatomical and morphological characteristics of the octopus arm, the key biomechanical features of interest to the design of a robotic arm have been identified. A design methodology has been developed based on the analysis of the muscular hydrostat properties. A prototype arm has been built using bespoke contracting pneumatic muscles and expanding elements. In the current stage of development the system has 15 actuated degrees of motion (DOM) and 8 degrees of freedom (DOF), all independently controllable through valves and a dedicated electronics and software interface. Pros and cons of the current design as well as practical prototyping trade-offs are thoroughly described.},

abstract = {— Visual place recognition under difficult perceptual conditions remains a challenging problem due to changing weather conditions, illumination and seasons. Long-term visual navigation approaches for robot localization should be robust to these dynamics of the environment. Existing methods typically leverage feature descriptions of whole images or image regions from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Some approaches also exploit sequential information to alleviate the problem of spatially inconsistent and non-perfect image matches. In this pa-per, we propose a novel approach for learning a discriminative holistic image representation which exploits the image content to create a dense and salient scene description. These salient descriptions are learnt over a variety of datasets under large perceptual changes. Such an approach enables us to precisely segment the regions of an image which are geometrically stable over large time lags. We combine features from these salient regions and an off-the-shelf holistic representation to form a more robust scene descriptor. We also introduce a semantically labeled dataset which captures extreme perceptual and structural scene dynamics over the course of 3 years. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments on data collected over several kilometers in Freiburg and show that our learnt image representation outperforms off-the-shelf features from the deep networks and hand-crafted features.},

abstract = {Soft fluidic actuators consisting of elastomeric matrices with embedded flexible materials are of particular interest to the robotics community because they are affordable and can be easily customized to a given application. However, the significant potential of such actuators is currently limited as their design has typically been based on intuition. In this paper, the principle of operation of these actuators is comprehensively analyzed and described through experimentally validated quasi-static analytical and finite-element method models for bending in free space and force generation when in contact with an object. This study provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create soft actuators by understanding how these vary their outputs as a function of input pressure for a number of geometrical parameters. Additionally, the proposed analytical model is implemented in a controller demonstrating its ability to convert pressure information to bending angle in real time. Such an understanding of soft multimaterial actuators will allow future design concepts to be rapidly iterated and their performance predicted, thus enabling new and innovative applications that produce more complex motions to be explored},

A smart electrical board consisting of signal conditioning circuits, A/D module and a micro-computer controller based communication module was built and integrated into the force sensor. The calibration experiments were performed using a force platform (EFP-S-2KNSA12) as a reference sensor, and in order to investigate interference errors of the sensor, preliminary characterization tests were implemented using a purposely developed characterization workstation.

abstract = {—Modern autonomous mobile robots require a strong understanding of their surroundings in order to safely operate in cluttered and dynamic environments. Monocular depth esti-mation offers a geometry-independent paradigm to detect free, navigable space with minimum space and power consumption. These represent highly desirable features, especially for micro aerial vehicles. In order to guarantee robust operation in real world scenarios, the estimator is required to generalize well in diverse environments. Most of the existent depth estima-tors do not consider generalization, and only benchmark their performance on publicly available datasets after specific fine-tuning. Generalization can be achieved by training on several heterogeneous datasets, but their collection and labeling is costly. In this work, we propose a Deep Neural Network for scene depth estimation that is trained on synthetic datasets, which allow inexpensive generation of ground truth data. We show how this approach is able to generalize well across different scenarios. In addition, we show how the addition of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers in the network helps to alleviate, in sequential image streams, some of the intrinsic limitations of monocular vision, such as global scale estimation, with low computational overhead. We demonstrate that the network is able to generalize well with respect to different real world environments without any fine-tuning, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset.},

Per 1,000 children, estimated prevalence was 5.8 for autism spectrum disorder and 2.4 for cerebral palsy; for Tourette syndrome, the data were insufficient. In the general population, per 1,000, the 1-year prevalence for migraine was 121, 7.1 for epilepsy, and 0.9 for multiple sclerosis. Among the elderly, the prevalence of Alzheimer disease was 67 and that of Parkinson disease was 9.5. For diseases best described by annual incidence per 100,000, the rate for stroke was 183, 101 for major traumatic brain injury, 4.5 for spinal cord injury, and 1.6 for ALS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Using the best available data, our survey of a limited number of disorders shows that the burden of neurologic illness affects many millions of people in the United States.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy has been found to be a promising treatment for substantially increasing the use of extremities affected by such neurologic injuries as stroke and traumatic brain injury in adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the applicability of this intervention to young children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: A randomized, controlled clinical trial of pediatric CI therapy in which 18 children with diagnosed hemiparesis associated with cerebral palsy (7-96 months old) were randomly assigned to receive either pediatric CI therapy or conventional treatment. Pediatric CI therapy involved promoting increased use of the more-affected arm and hand by intensive training (using shaping) of the more-impaired upper extremity for 6 hours/day for 21 consecutive days coupled with bivalved casting of the child's less-affected upper extremity for that period. Children's functional upper-extremity skills were assessed in the laboratory (blinded scoring) and at home (parent ratings) just prior, after, and 3 weeks posttreatment. Treated children were followed for 6 months. RESULTS: Children receiving pediatric CI therapy compared with controls acquired significantly more new classes of motoric skills (9.3 vs 2.2); demonstrated significant gains in the mean amount (2.1 vs 0.1) and quality (1.7 vs 0.3) of more-affected arm use at home; and in a laboratory motor function test displayed substantial improvement including increases in unprompted use of the more-affected upper extremity (52.1{\%} vs 2.1{\%} of items). Benefits were maintained over 6 months, with supplemental evidence of quality-of-life changes for many children. CONCLUSION: Pediatric CI therapy produced major and sustained improvement in motoric function in the young children with hemiparesis in the study.},

abstract = {Established design and fabrication guidelines exist for achieving a variety of motions with soft actuators such as bending, contraction, extension, and twisting. These guidelines typically involve multi-step molding of composite materials (elastomers, paper, fiber, etc.) along with specially designed geometry. In this paper we present the design and fabrication of a robust, fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator where its bend radius and bending axis can be mechanically-programed with a flexible, selectively-placed conformal covering that acts to mechanically constrain motion. Several soft actuators were fabricated and their displacement and force capabilities were measured experimentally and compared to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Finally, a prototype two-digit end- effector was designed and programmed with the conformal covering to shape match a rectangular object. We demonstrated improved gripping force compared to a pure bending actuator. We envision this approach enabling rapid customization of soft actuator function for grasping applications where the geometry of the task is known a priori.},

abstract = {Legged robots have the potential to navigate in challenging terrain, and$\backslash$nthus to exceed the mobility of wheeled vehicles. However, their control$\backslash$nis more difficult as legged robots need to deal with foothold$\backslash$ncomputation, leg trajectories and posture control in order to achieve$\backslash$nsuccessful navigation. In this paper, we present a new framework for the$\backslash$nhydraulic quadruped robot HyQ, which performs goal-oriented navigation$\backslash$non unknown rough terrain using inertial measurement data and$\backslash$nstereo-vision. This work uses our previously presented reactive$\backslash$ncontroller framework with balancing control and extends it with visual$\backslash$nfeedback to enable closed-loop gait adjustment. On one hand, the camera$\backslash$nimages are used to keep the robot walking towards a visual target by$\backslash$ncorrecting its heading angle if the robot deviates from it. On the other$\backslash$nhand, the stereo camera is used to estimate the size of the obstacles on$\backslash$nthe ground plane and thus the terrain roughness. The locomotion$\backslash$ncontroller then adjusts the step height and the velocity according to$\backslash$nthe size of the obstacles. This results in a robust and autonomous$\backslash$ngoal-oriented navigation over difficult terrain while subject to$\backslash$ndisturbances from the ground irregularities or external forces. Indoor$\backslash$nand outdoor experiments with our quadruped robot show the effectiveness$\backslash$nof this framework.},

The main source of the qualitative uncertainty are the mixed measurements. This effect has been investigated experimentally and explained by analyzing the physical phenomena underlying the sensor operation. A local grid map has been used to remove the erroneous range measurements. A novel fuzzy-set-based algorithm has been employed to update evidence in the grid. The results of tests show that this algorithm is superior to the common Bayesian approach, when qualitative errors in range measurements are present.},

Repetitive hand movement is often used as a rehabilitation technique in order to regain hand movement and strength. In order to facilitate this rehabilitation, a robotic glove was designed to aid in the movement and coordination of gripping exercises. This glove utilizes a cable system to open and close a patients hand. The cables are actuated by servomotors, mounted in a backpack weighing 13.2 lbs including battery power sources. The glove can be controlled in terms of finger position and grip force through switch interface, software program, or surface myoelectric (sEMG) signal. The primary control modes of the system provide: active assistance, active resistance and a preprogrammed mode. This project developed a working prototype of the rehabilitative robotic glove which actuates the fingers over a full range of motion across one degree-of-freedom, and is capable of generating a maximum 15N grip force.},

Methods: We conducted population-based surveillance of 8-year-old children in 2006 (N= 142,338), in areas of Alabama, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Missouri. This multi-site collaboration involved retrospective record review at multiple sources. We reported CP subtype, co-occurring DDs, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, and walking ability as well as CP period prevalence by race/ethnicity and sex. Results: CP prevalence was 3.3 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 3.1-3.7) per 1000 and varied by site, ranging from 2.9 (Wisconsin) to 3.8 (Georgia) per 1000, 8-year olds (p{\textless} 0.02). Approximately 81{\%} had spastic CP. Among children with CP, 8{\%} had an autism spectrum disorder and 35{\%} had epilepsy.

Inspired by the bending abdomen of lobsters, hybrid actuators are built with serially jointed rigid shells actuated by pressurized soft chambers inside to generate bending motions. Such bio-inspiration absorbs features from the classical rigid-bodied robotics with precisely-defined motion generation, as well as the emerging soft robotics with light-weight, physically safe, and adaptive actuation. The fabrication procedure is described, followed by experiments to mechanically characterize these actuators. Finally, an open-palm glove design integrated with these hybrid actuators are presented for a qualitative case study.

Therefore, we chose fiber-reinforced SPAs in this study. Similarly, the actuator has the inner silicone layer reinforced by high-density fiber winding and an external layer for encapsulation. Producing SPAs with consistent dimensions and mechanical characteristics is of crucial importance to this research and to the future development of the force model and instability theory. Therefore, we made a few improvements in our SPA fabrication by using our customized winding machine, and Cameo cutting machine. Although further refinement can be achieved by fully mechanized processes, our current fabrication can also achieve high level of SPA consistency.

abstract = {— This paper presents an algorithm for solving the problem of tracking smooth curves by a fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle travelling with a constant airspeed and under a constant wind disturbance. The algorithm is based on the idea of following a guiding vector field which is constructed from the implicit function that describes the desired (possibly time-varying) trajectory. The output of the algorithm can be directly expressed in terms of the bank angle of the UAV in order to achieve coordinated turns. Furthermore, the algorithm can be tuned offline such that physical constraints of the UAV, e.g. the maximum bank angle, will not be violated in a neighborhood of the desired trajectory. We provide the corresponding theoretical convergence analysis and performance results from actual flights.},

abstract = {Ever more robust, accurate and detailed mapping using visual sensing has proven to be an enabling factor for mobile robots across a wide variety of applications. For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user interaction, maps need extend beyond geometry and appearence - they need to contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state of the art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondence between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of approximately 25Hz.},

This paper will not address the physics of the quantum vacuum plasma thruster (QVPT), but instead will describe the recent test campaign. In addition, it contains a brief description of the supporting radio frequency (RF) field analysis, lessons learned, and potential applications of the technology to space exploration missions. During the first (Cannae) portion of the campaign, approximately 40 micronewtons of thrust were observed in an RF resonant cavity test article excited at approximately 935 megahertz and 28 watts. During the subsequent (tapered cavity) portion of the campaign, approximately 91 micronewtons of thrust were observed in an RF resonant cavity test article excited at approximately 1933 megahertz and 17 watts. Testing was performed on a low- thrust torsion pendulum that is capable of detecting force at a single-digit micronewton level. Test campaign results indicate that the RF resonant cavity thruster design, which is unique as an electric propulsion device, is producing a force that is not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon and therefore is potentially demonstrating an interaction with the quantum vacuum virtual plasma.},

However, IRL methods face practical limitations that stem from the need to repeat costly planning procedures. In this paper, we propose Rapidly Exploring Learning Trees (RLT *), which learns the cost functions of Optimal Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT *) from demonstration, thereby making inverse learning methods applicable to more complex tasks. Our approach extends Maximum Margin Planning to work with RRT * cost functions. Furthermore, we propose a caching scheme that greatly reduces the computational cost of this approach. Experimental results on simulated and real-robot data from a social navigation scenario show that RLT * achieves better performance at lower computational cost than existing methods. We also successfully deploy control policies learned with RLT * on a real telepresence robot.},

This requires a non-trivial extension of previously proposed kinematic models, and poses challenges for real-time control of the robot. We introduce a tangling/untangling algorithm to map between overall cable lengths and per-section cable lengths.

Softness, flexibility, and variable stiffness in robotics have been recognized as highly desirable characteristics for many applications. A number of solutions were proposed ranging from entirely soft robots (such as those composed mainly from soft materials such as silicone), via flexible continuum and snake-like robots, to rigid-link robots enhanced by joints that exhibit an elastic behavior either implemented in hardware or achieved purely by means of intelligent control. Although these are very good solutions paving the path to safe human–robot interaction, we propose here a new approach that focuses on creating stiffness controllability for the linkages between the robot joints. This article proposes a replacement for the traditionally rigid robot link—the new link is equipped with an additional capability of...},

In comparison, TOPP subject to third-order constraints (e.g. jerk, torque rate, etc.) has received far less attention and remains largely open. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the TOPP problem with third-order constraints. In particular, we identify two major difficulties: (i) how to smoothly connect optimal profiles, and (ii) how to address singularities, which stop profile integration prematurely. We propose a new algorithm, TOPP3, which addresses these two difficulties and thereby constitutes an important milestone towards an efficient computational solution to TOPP with third-order constraints.},

This contribution is especially important in robotics, where a vast number of sensors provide continuous observation data. A continuous-observation policy representation is introduced using Stochastic Kernel-based Finite State Automata (SK-FSAs). An SK-FSA search algorithm titled Entropy-based Policy Search using Continuous Kernel Observations (EPSCKO) is introduced and applied to the first ever continuous-observation Dec-POMDP/Dec-POSMDP domain, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art discrete approaches. This methodology is equally applicable to Dec-POMDPs and Dec-POSMDPs, though the empirical analysis presented focuses on Dec-POSMDPs due to their higher scalability. To improve convergence, an entropy injection policy search acceleration approach for both continuous and discrete observation cases is also developed and shown to improve convergence rates without degrading policy quality.},

abstract = {Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a visual navigation algorithm for the six-legged walking robot DLR Crawler in rough terrain. The algorithm is based on stereo images from which depth images are computed using the semi-global matching (SGM) method. Further, a visual odometry is calculated along with an error measure. Pose estimates are obtained by fusing inertial data with relative leg odometry and visual odometry measurements using an indirect information filter. The visual odometry error measure is used in the filtering process to put lower weights on erroneous visual odometry data, hence, improving the robustness of pose estimation. From the estimated poses and the depth images, a dense digital terrain map is created by applying the locus method. The traversability of the terrain is estimated by a plane fitting approach and paths are planned using a D* Lite planner taking the traversability of the terrain and the current motion capabilities of the robot into account. Motion commands and the traversability measures of the upcoming terrain are sent to the walking layer of the robot so that it can choose an appropriate gait for the terrain. Experimental results show the accuracy of the navigation algorithm and its robustness against visual disturbances.},

abstract = {The white cane is a widely used mobility aid that helps visually impaired people navigate the surroundings. While it reliably and intuitively extends the detection range of ground-level obstacles and drop-offs to about 1.2 m, it lacks the ability to detect trunk and head-level obstacles. Electronic Travel Aids (ETAs) have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but have found minimal adoption due to limitations such as low information content and low reliability thereof. Although existing ETAs extend the sensing range beyond that of the conventional white cane, most of them do not detect head-level obstacles and drop-offs, nor can they identify the vertical extent of obstacles. Furthermore, some ETAs work independent of the white cane, and thus reliable detection of surface textures and drop-offs is not provided. This paper introduces a novel ETA, the Advanced Augmented White Cane, which detects obstacles at four vertical levels and provides multi-sensory feedback. We evaluated the device in five blindfolded subjects through reaction time measurements following the detection of an obstacle, as well as through the reliability of dropoff detection. The results showed that our aid could help the user successfully detect an obstacle and identify its height, with an average reaction time of 410 msec. Drop-offs were reliably detected with an intraclass correlation {\textgreater} 0.95. This work is a first step towards a low-cost ETA to complement the functionality of the conventional white cane.},

abstract = {Abstract In this article, we have proposed a novel robotic finger design principle aimed to address two challenges in soft pneumatic grippers—the controllability of the stiffness and the controllability of the bending position. The proposed finger design is composed of a 3D printed multimaterial substrate and a soft pneumatic actuator. The substrate has four polylactic acid (PLA) segments interlocked with three shape memory polymer (SMP) joints, inspired by bones and joints in human fingers. By controlling the thermal energy of an SMP joint, the stiffness of the joints is modulated due to the dramatic change in SMP elastic modulus around its glass transition temperature (Tg). When SMP joints are heated above Tg, they exhibit very small stiffness, allowing the finger to easily bend around the SMP joints if the attached soft actuator is actuated. When there is no force from the soft actuator, shape recovery stress in SMP contributes to the finger's shape restoration. Since each joint's rotation can be indiv...},

The robot employs a compliant body with embedded actuators emulating the slender anatomical form of a fish. In addition, the robot has a novel fluidic actuation system that drives body motion and has all the subsystems of a traditional robot onboard: power, actuation, processing, and control. At the core of the fish's soft body is an array of fluidic elastomer actuators. We design the fish to emulate escape responses in addition to forward swimming because such maneuvers require rapid body accelerations and continuum-body motion. These maneuvers showcase the performance capabilities of this self-contained robot.

While a narrow class of FREEs known as McKibben's actuators have been extensively studied, there is a wide unexplored class with complex sets of motion patterns. Combining these actuators in parallel can yield versatile motion patterns resulting in a large overall workspace. Mobility of individual actuators is enforced by inextensibility of fibers and incompressibility of fluids, which in turn drives the net attainable motions. In this paper, we map the mobility of individual FREE actuators to all possible resultant motions that a combination of three sets of actuators arranged in a triangular configuration would undergo. This understanding has resulted in a preliminary design tool that determines individual FREE topologies for a required set of motion patterns. Five case studies that result from this methodology are prototyped and tested for comparison of the predicted and obtained motion directions.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},

MPMP computes the poses of these trajectories so that they follow the path closely and, at the same time, are at a safe distance of eventual obstacles. Our experiments have shown that MPMP is able to compute trajectories that precisely follow a path produced by a Human driver (distance of 0.15 m in average) while smoothly driving IARA at speeds of up to 32.4 km/h (9 m/s).},

abstract = {Acquiring the accurate 3-D position of a target person around a robot provides fundamental and valuable information that is applicable to a wide range of robotic tasks, including home service, navigation and entertainment. This paper presents a real-time robotic 3-D human tracking system which combines a monocular camera with an ultrasonic sensor by the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed system consists of three sub-modules: monocular camera sensor tracking model, ultrasonic sensor tracking model and multi-sensor fusion. An improved visual tracking algorithm is presented to provide partial location estimation (2-D). The algorithm is designed to overcome severe occlusions, scale variation, target missing and achieve robust re-detection. The scale accuracy is further enhanced by the estimated 3-D information. An ultrasonic sensor array is employed to provide the range information from the target person to the robot and Gaussian Process Regression is used for partial location estimation (2-D). EKF is adopted to sequentially process multiple, heterogeneous measurements arriving in an asynchronous order from the vision sensor and the ultrasonic sensor separately. In the experiments, the proposed tracking system is tested in both simulation platform and actual mobile robot for various indoor and outdoor scenes. The experimental results show the superior performance of the 3-D tracking system in terms of both the accuracy and robustness.},

abstract = {Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a disease which attacks the synovial tissue lubricating skeletal joints. This systemic condition affects the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, muscles and tendons that contribute to loss of function and Range of Motion (ROM). Traditional measurement of arthritis requires labour intensive personal examination by medical staff which through their objective measures may hinder the enactment and analysis of arthritis rehabilitation. This paper presents the development of a smart glove to facilitate this rehabilitative process through the integration of sensors, processors and wireless technology to empirically measure ROM. The Tyndall/University of Ulster glove uses a combination of 20 bend sensors, 16 tri-axial accelerometers and 11 force sensors to detect joint movement. All sensors are placed on a flexible PCB to provide high levels of flexibility and sensor stability. The system operation means that the glove does not require calibration for each glove wearer.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate a wide variety of robotic skills, but learning each new skill requires considerable real-world data collection and manual representation engineering to design policy classes or features. Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be decomposed into "task-specific" and "robot-specific" modules, where the task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information, such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that were not seen during training. Using a novel neural network architecture, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual and non-visual tasks.},

However, this problem is intractable for continuous-time stochastic systems in general and the solution is difficult to approximate if non-instantaneous nonlinear performance indices are present. In this work, we provide an efficient algorithm, PIPC (Probabilistic Inference for Planning and Control), that yields approximately optimal policies with arbitrary higher-order nonlinear performance indices. Using probabilistic inference and a Gaussian process representation of trajectories, PIPC exploits the underlying sparsity of the problem such that its complexity scales linearly in the number of nonlinear factors. We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm in a receding horizon setting with multiple systems in simulation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a cooperative control of a wearable robot for paraplegics. The control system adjusts the stride length and walking velocity of a robot according to user's voluntary movement while generating a continuous walking pattern. We assume that the desired stride length and walking speed correspond to the preceding motion of a walking aid (walker), and the motion of the walker by the user was measured by a laser range sensor and an accelerometer. The continuous walking pattern during a step was planned by optimization of joint trajectories under inequality conditions. To perform continuous walking, the desired trajectory is required before the walker movement. To adjust the foot placement according to the walker movement, the desired walking pattern in the late swing phase is replanned. For the latest movement distance of the walker, the posture at heel strike is modified by Newton-like iterative calculations. We confirmed that a normal subject could walk continuously with a wearable robot controlled by our system while changing the stride length and walking speed.},

As the robot touches the world, its state space collapses to a contact manifold that we represent implicitly using a signed distance field. This allows us to extend the MPF to higher (six or more) dimensional state spaces. Earlier work (which explicitly represents the contact manifold) only shows the MPF in two or three dimensions. Through a series of experiments, we show that the implicit MPF converges faster and is more accurate than a conventional particle filter during periods of persistent contact. We present three methods of sampling the implicit contact manifold, and compare them in experiments.},

The soft manipulation system can grasp randomly positioned objects within its reachable envelope and move them to a desired location without human intervention. The autonomous planning system leverages the compliance and continuum bending of the soft grasping manipulator to achieve repeatable grasps in the presence of uncertainty.

Fabrics represent a class of highly conformable materials that have the potential for embedded function and are highly integrated into our daily lives. In this work, we present a robotic fabric with embedded actuation and sensing. Attaching the same robotic fabric to a soft body in different ways leads to unique motions and sensor modalities with many different applications for robotics. In one mode, the robotic fabric acts around the circumference of the body, and compression of the body is achieved. Attaching the robotic fabric in another way, along one surface of a body for example, bending is achieved. We use thread-like actuators and sensors to functionalize fabric via a standard textile manufacturing process (sewing). The actuated fabric presented herein yields a contractile force of 9.6N and changes in length by approximately 60{\%} when unconstrained. The integrated strain sensor is evaluated and found to have an RMS error of 14.6{\%}, and qualitatively differentiates between the compressive and bending motions demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the PUMP (Parallel Uncertainty-aware Multiobjective Planning) algorithm for addressing the stochastic kinodynamic motion planning problem, whereby one seeks a low-cost, dynamically-feasible motion plan subject to a constraint on collision probability (CP). To ensure exhaustive evaluation of candidate motion plans (as needed to tradeoff the competing objectives of performance and safety), PUMP incrementally builds the Pareto front of the problem, accounting for the optimization objective and an approximation of CP. This is performed by a massively parallel multiobjective search, here implemented with a focus on GPUs. Upon termination of the exploration phase, PUMP searches the Pareto set of motion plans to identify the lowest cost solution that is certified to satisfy the CP constraint (according to an asymptotically exact estimator). We introduce a novel particle-based CP approximation scheme, designed for efficient GPU implementation, which accounts for dependencies over the history of a trajectory execution. We present numerical experiments for quadrotor planning wherein PUMP identifies solutions in {\~{}}100 ms, evaluating over one hundred thousand partial plans through the course of its exploration phase. The results show that this multiobjective search achieves a lower motion plan cost, for the same CP constraint, compared to a safety buffer-based search heuristic and repeated RRT trials.},

abstract = {In recent years, many researchers have been focusing on the different novel techniques in designing pneumatic soft actuator that can produce bending motion. This paper presents a novel soft actuator design; a combination of different braided angles of artificial muscle applied on a single chamber soft actuator to produce bending motion. The actuator construction is based on the theory of contraction and extension of artificial muscle. It comprises of fiber-reinforced inside silicone rubber and is capable to create one-sided bending motion. Analysis of nonlinear finite element method is conducted to predict the direction and bending angles of the actuator before a prototype of actuator is fabricated. Based on the results, the developed soft actuator can realize bending motion after standard pressure driving experiment is executed.},

abstract = {The paper describes a control architecture for industrial robotic applications allowing human/robot interactions, using an admittance control scheme and direct sensing of the human inputs. The aim of the proposed scheme is to support the operator of an industrial robot, equipped with a force/torque (F/T) sensor on the end-effector, during human/robot collaboration tasks involving heavy payloads carried by the robot. In these practical applications, the dynamics of the load may significatively affect the measurements of the F/T sensor. Model-based compensation of such dynamic effects requires to compute linear acceleration and angular acceleration/velocity of the load, that in this paper are estimated by means of a quaternion-based Kalman filter and assuming that the only available measurements come from the forward kinematics of the robot. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and its industrial applicability.},

abstract = {— We consider object recognition in the context of lifelong learning, where a robotic agent learns to discriminate between a growing number of object classes as it accumulates experience about the environment. We propose an incremental variant of the Regularized Least Squares for Classification (RLSC) algorithm, and exploit its structure to seamlessly add new classes to the learned model. The presented algorithm addresses the problem of having an unbalanced proportion of training examples per class, which occurs when new objects are presented to the system for the first time. We evaluate our algorithm on both a machine learning benchmark dataset and two challenging object recognition tasks in a robotic setting. Empirical evidence shows that our approach achieves comparable or higher classification performance than its batch counterpart when classes are unbalanced, while being significantly faster.},

abstract = {We present EVO, an Event-based Visual Odometry algorithm. Our algorithm successfully leverages the outstanding properties of event cameras to track fast camera motions while recovering a semi-dense 3D map of the environment. The imple- mentation runs in real-time on a standard CPU and outputs up to several hundred pose estimates per second. Due to the nature of event cameras, our algorithm is unaffected by motion blur and operates very well in challenging, high dynamic range conditions with strong illumination changes. To achieve this, we combine a novel, event-based tracking approach based on image-to-model alignment with a recent event-based 3D reconstruction algorithm in a parallel fashion. Additionally, we show that the output of our pipeline can be used to reconstruct intensity images from the binary event stream, though our algorithm does not require such intensity information.We believe that this work makes significant progress in SLAM by unlocking the potential of event cameras. This allows us to tackle challenging scenarios that are currently inaccessible to standard cameras.},

abstract = {This paper presents a physically-based algorithm to interactively simulate and control the motion of soft robots interacting with their environment. We use the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate the non-linear deformation of the soft structure, its actuators, and surroundings, and propose a control method relying on a quadratic optimization to find the inverse of the model. The novelty of this work is that the deformations due to contacts, including self-collisions, are taken into account in the optimization process. We propose a dedicated and efficient solver to handle the linear complementarity constraints introduced by the contacts. Thus, the method allows interactive transfer of the motion of soft robots from their task space to their actuator space while interacting with their surrounding. The method is generic and tested on several numerical examples and on a real cable-driven soft robot.},

abstract = {Conventional rigid body robots typically use few degrees of freedom (DOF). This results in a manipulator that lacks flexibility and maneuverability when compared to continuum robots that utilize a much higher number of DOF. However, due to their continuous nature, the difficulty of measuring and controlling a large number of actuated DOF, and their high degree of nonlinearity, the development of control algorithms for continuum robot manipulators is an ongoing challenge. This paper presents an algorithm inspired by biological solutions from live octopus that utilizes division of functionality to achieve simple and robust control of continuum arm based systems. Simulated results for single and multiple dynamic continuum arms show the controller is capable of producing motions similar to that of octopus. The resulting controller is also computationally efficient enough for real-time implementation. In future this work will be implemented on a prototype robot with multiple continuum arms.},

Our problems- some straightforward, some more challenging, some "thinking problems" not accessible by a CAS, some open-ended- reflect this modern situation. Computer Experiments , using the computer as an instrument of "experimental mathematics" for exploration and research. These are mostly open-ended experiments, demonstrating the use of computers in experimentally finding results, which may be provable afterward or may be valuable heuristic qualitative guidelines to the engineer, in particular in complicated problems. More on modeling and selecting methods, tasks that usually cannot be automated. Many sections were rewritten in a more detailed fashion, to make it a simpler book. This also resulted in a better balance between theory and applications. Student Solutions Manual and Study Guide enlarged, upon explicit requests of the users. This manual contains worked-out solutions to carefully selected odd-numbered problems as well as general comments and hints on studying the text and working further problems.

In this paper, we report our findings during the development and evaluation of a fully integrated system that is energy efficient and enables MAVs to pick up and deliver objects with partly ferrous surface of varying shapes and weights. This is achieved by using a novel combination of an electro-permanent magnetic gripper with a passively compliant structure and integration with detection, control and servo positioning algorithms. The system's ability to grasp stationary and moving objects was tested, as well as its ability to cope with different shapes of the object and external disturbances. We show that such a system can be successfully deployed in scenarios where an object with partly ferrous parts needs to be gripped and placed in a predetermined location.},

abstract = {Autonomous learning of robotic skills can allow general-purpose robots to learn wide behavioral repertoires without requiring extensive manual engineering. However, robotic skill learning methods typically make one of several trade-offs to enable practical real-world learning, such as requiring manually designed policy or value function representations, initialization from human-provided demonstrations, instrumentation of the training environment, or extremely long training times. In this paper, we propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for learning manipulation skills that can train general-purpose neural network policies with minimal human engineering, while still allowing for fast, efficient learning in stochastic environments. Our approach builds on the guided policy search (GPS) algorithm, which transforms the reinforcement learning problem into supervised learning from a computational teacher (without human demonstrations). In contrast to prior GPS methods, which require a consistent set of initial states to which the system must be reset after each episode, our approach can handle randomized initial states, allowing it to be used in environments where deterministic resets are impossible. We compare our method to existing policy search techniques in simulation, showing that it can train high-dimensional neural network policies with the same sample efficiency as prior GPS methods, and present real-world results on a PR2 robotic manipulator.},

abstract = {Abstract Real-world environments are complex, unstructured, and often fragile. Soft robotics offers a solution for robots to safely interact with the environment and human coworkers, but suffers from a host of challenges in sensing and control of continuously deformable bodies. To overcome these challenges, this article considers a modular soft robotic architecture that offers proprioceptive sensing of pressure-operated bending actuation modules. We present integrated custom magnetic curvature sensors embedded in the neutral axis of bidirectional bending actuators. We describe our recent advances in the design and fabrication of these modules to improve the reliability of proprioceptive curvature feedback over our prior work. In particular, we study the effect of dimensional parameters on improving the linearity of curvature measurements. In addition, we present a sliding-mode controller formulation that drives the binary solenoid valve states directly, giving the control system the ability to hold the ac...},

@article{Decomposition,
abstract = {In many applications where linear systems appear, one needs to solve Ax = b for many different vectors b. For instance, a structure must be tested under several different loads, not just one. As in the example of a truss (9.2), the loading in such a problem is usually represented by the vector b. Gaussian elimination with pivoting is the most efficient and accurate way to solve a linear system. Most of the work in this method is spent on the matrix A itself. If we need to solve several different systems with the same A, and A is big, then we would like to avoid repeating the steps of Gaussian elimination on A for every different b. This can be accomplished by the LU decomposition, which in effect records the steps of Gaussian elimination. LU decomposition The main idea of the LU decomposition is to record the steps used in Gaussian elimination on A in the places where the zero is produced. Consider the matrix A =   1 −2 3 2 −5 12 0 2 −10   . The first step of Gaussian elimination is to subtract 2 times the first row from the second row. In order to record what we have done, we will put the multiplier, 2, into the place it was used to make a zero, i.e. the second row, first column. In order to make it clear that it is a record of the step and not an element of A, we will put it in parentheses. This leads to },

Successful interventions have stressed the importance of repeated practice to facilitate rehabilitation. Thus, we have developed a servo-controlled glove to assist extension of individual digits to promote practice of grasp-and-release movements with the hand. This glove, the PneuGlove, permits free movement of the arm throughout its workspace. A novel immersive virtual reality environment was created for training movement in conjunction with the device. Seven stroke survivors with chronic hand impairment participated in 18 training sessions with the PneuGlove over 6 weeks. Overall, subjects displayed a significant 6-point improvement in the upper extremity score on the Fugl-Meyer assessment and this increase was maintained at the evaluation held one month after conclusion of all training (p {\textless} 0.01). The majority of this gain came from an increase in the hand/wrist score (3.8-point increase, p {\textless} 0.01). Thus, the system shows promise for rehabilitative training of hand movements after stroke.},

abstract = {The budgeted information gathering problem - where a robot with a fixed fuel budget is required to maximize the amount of information gathered from the world - appears in practice across a wide range of applications in autonomous exploration and inspection with mobile robots. Although there is an extensive amount of prior work investigating effective approximations of the problem, these methods do not address the fact that their performance is heavily dependent on distribution of objects in the world. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by proposing a novel data-driven imitation learning framework. We present an efficient algorithm, EXPLORE, that trains a policy on the target distribution to imitate a clairvoyant oracle - an oracle that has full information about the world and computes non-myopic solutions to maximize information gathered. We validate the approach on a spectrum of results on a number of 2D and 3D exploration problems that demonstrates the ability of EXPLORE to adapt to different object distributions. Additionally, our analysis provides theoretical insight into the behavior of EXPLORE. Our approach paves the way forward for efficiently applying data-driven methods to the domain of information gathering.},

We jointly optimize the Center of Mass (CoM) motion and the foothold locations, while considering terrain conditions. We use a terrain costmap to quantify the desirability of a foothold location. We increase the gait's adaptability to the terrain by optimizing the step phase duration and modulating the trunk attitude, resulting in motions with guaranteed stability. We show that the combi-nation of parametric models, stochastic-based exploration and receding horizon planning allows us to handle the many local minima associated with different terrain conditions and walking patterns. This combination delivers robust motion plans without the need for warm-starting. Moreover, we use soft-constraints to allow for increased flexibility when searching in the cost landscape of our problem. We showcase the performance of our trajectory optimization framework on multiple terrain conditions and validate our method in realistic simulation sce-narios and experimental trials on a hydraulic, torque controlled quadruped robot.},

abstract = {In this paper, a general study on improving adaptability of quadruped walking and climbing robot in complex environment is presented. First, a sensing system composed of range and gyroscope sensors in a novel arrangement is developed. By combining the sensing signals and the internal state of the robot, the surface geometry of the environment is sufficiently reconstructed in real-time. Secondly, a planning algorithm for the robot to overcome the reconstructed environment is conducted. Based on the reshaped surface, the planning algorithm not only provides the exact body trajectory and foot positions but also the adaptability of the robot in a specific environment. A method to improve the adaptability of the walking and climbing robot is also introduced. Thanks to the adherent ability of the robot, the center of gravity of the robot is allowed to move outside the support polygon to increase the reach-ability of the next swing leg. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the performances of the experiments in complex environments using a quadruped walking and climbing robot named MRWALLSPECT IV. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The decision support framework moves decision-making in urban water systems from traditional command and control approaches that tend to focus on an outcome at a point in time to a more sustainable, inclusive and dynamic decision-making process driven by social learning and engagement. While available models and evaluation techniques provide valuable input to decision-making, the complex nature of urban water systems requires more than just social and economic criteria to be considered as part of decision support frameworks. The authors believe that current decision support frameworks need to be presented in a way that incorporates adaptive management and integrated urban water management strengths at the strategic and operational level. The inclusion of social learning and engagement is necessary to achieving this end.},

Silicone rubber layers with channel patterns, cast with 3-D printed molds, are bonded to create embedded microchannels, and a conductive liquid is injected into the microchannels. The channel dimensions are 200 µm (width) × 300 µm (height). The size of the sensor is 25 mm × 25 mm, and the thickness is approximately 3.5 mm. The prototype is tested with a materials tester and showed linearity in strain sensing and nonlinearity in pressure sensing. The sensor signal is repeatable in both cases.

abstract = {Visual attention is the cognitive process that allows humans to parse a large amount of sensory data by selecting relevant information and filtering out irrelevant stimuli. This papers develops a computational framework for visual attention in robots. We consider a Visual Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem in which a robot needs to estimate its state using an on-board camera and an inertial sensor. The robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to time and energy constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under limited resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the performance of visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key features. First, it is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by a metric quantifying the task performance. Second, it exploits the notion of anticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot dynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a time horizon. Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a greedy algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it provides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that the greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection. Simulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach leads to dramatic improvements in the VIN performance. In the easy scenarios, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of localization errors. In the most challenging scenarios, it enables accurate visual-inertial navigation while the state of the art fails to track robot's motion during aggressive maneuvers.},

abstract = {Visual SLAM in low illumination scenes remains a considerably challenging task since the available amount of appearance information frequently stays insufficient. To tackle with this problem, we propose a novel SLAM framework by using both appearance information and thermal information, which possesses illumination-free recognizable contents, in a flexible manner. The key idea is to continuously update a RGB- T map, which contains both RGB and thermal map points to implement location and mapping. More specifically, in our SLAM system, we detect features in both RGB and thermal images and combine them together to update the RGB-T map and implement simultaneous location and mapping. Both quan- titative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially under low illumination environments.},

abstract = {Performing detailed work on objects requires precise localization using accurate sensors. Currently humans aid machines in localization either by direct operation, or implicitly by designing a sequence of actions a robot follows. Our approach to automate localization is to reason over many potential actions, perform the best information gathering action, and then use the measurement obtained to update a non-Gaussian belief. We propose a method for autonomous localization of objects with initial 6DOF uncertainty capable of reasoning about and performing accurate measurements with arbitrary error models. We modify a particle filter to
handle the accurate measurements produced by tactile or laser sensors. We then show how the expected information gain of the proposed measurement can be calculated efficiently from these particles. We performed experiments, both in simulation and on hardware, that show our method is both fast and accurate.},

abstract = {While a number of devices have recently been developed to facilitate hand rehabilitation after stroke, most place some restrictions on movement of the digits or arm. Thus, a novel glove was developed which can provide independent extension assistance to each digit while still allowing full arm movement. This pneumatic glove, the PneuGlove, can be used for training grasp-and-release movements either with real objects or with virtual objects in a virtual reality environment. Two groups of stroke survivors, with seven subjects in each group, completed a six-week rehabilitation training protocol, consisting of three 1-h sessions held each week. One group wore the PneuGlove during training, performed both within a novel virtual reality environment and outside of it with physical objects, while the other group completed the same training without the device. Across subjects, significant improvements were observed in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremity (p {\textless} 0.001), the hand/wrist portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (p {\textless} 0.001), the Box and Blocks test (p {\textless} 0.005), and palmar pinch strength (p {\textless} 0.005). While changes in the two groups were not statistically different, the group using the PneuGlove did show greater mean improvement on each of these measures, such as gains of 3.7 versus 2.4 points on the hand/wrist portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and 14 N versus 5 N in palmar pinch.},

abstract = {— During robot-assisted dressing, a robot manipu-lates a garment in contact with a person's body. Inferring the forces applied to the person's body by the garment might enable a robot to provide more effective assistance and give the robot insight into what the person feels. However, complex mechanics govern the relationship between the robot's end effector and these forces. Using a physics-based simulation and data-driven methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of inferring forces across a person's body using only end effector measurements. Specifically, we present a long short-term memory (LSTM) network that at each time step takes a 9-dimensional input vector of force, torque, and velocity measurements from the robot's end effector and outputs a force map consisting of hundreds of inferred force magnitudes across the person's body. We trained and evaluated LSTMs on two tasks: pulling a hospital gown onto an arm and pulling shorts onto a leg. For both tasks, the LSTMs produced force maps that were similar to ground truth when visualized as heat maps across the limbs. We also evaluated their performance in terms of root-mean-square error. Their performance degraded when the end effector velocity was increased outside the training range, but generalized well to limb rotations. Overall, our results suggest that robots could learn to infer the forces people feel during robot-assisted dressing, although the extent to which this will generalize to the real world remains an open question.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the task of designing a modular neural network architecture that jointly solves different tasks. As an example we use the tasks of depth estimation and semantic segmentation given a single RGB image. The main focus of this work is to analyze the cross-modality influence between depth and semantic prediction maps on their joint refinement. While most previous works solely focus on measuring improvements in accuracy, we propose a way to quantify the cross-modality influence. We show that there is a relationship between final accuracy and cross-modality influence, although not a simple linear one. Hence a larger cross-modality influence does not necessarily translate into an improved accuracy. We find that a beneficial balance between the cross-modality influences can be achieved by network architecture and conjecture that this relationship can be utilized to understand different network design choices. Towards this end we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that fuses the state of the state-of-the-art results for depth estimation and semantic labeling. By balancing the cross-modality influences between depth and semantic prediction, we achieve improved results for both tasks using the NYU-Depth v2 benchmark.},

Supporting such a transition requires new governance frameworks that can accommodate complexity and uncertainty, and organisational cultures that embrace experimentation and learning. This empirically focused research paper examines how eleven, alternative local-scale experiments were initiated while operating in an unsympathetic regime. Furthermore, the perceptions of more than 150 urban water practitioners across Australia are presented, regarding the importance of and difficulty in undertaking experimentation in the urban water sector, and the necessary mechanisms for influencing a step change to sustainable urban water management practices. Interviewees revealed perceived limitations in experimenting with new technologies and practices when operating within a hierarchical and market-based governance paradigm. Also, industry conservatism and the dominant risk-based management approach both operate as significant constraints to promoting an experimentation culture, and are closely related to concerns about public health and financial implications. Overall, the research highlights the Australian urban water sector is willing to embrace learning-by-doing; however, a stronger emphasis on promoting an organisational and industry-wide culture of experimentation and learning is required. Policy implications for future water governance are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Closing small defects in the body typically requires stitching of tissues during surgery. Toward a minimally invasive approach, Roche et al. engineered a balloon catheter with a reflective surface coating that could be used to adhere biodegradable patches to tissues. The device unfolds the patch and its adhesive, delivers ultraviolet (UV) light, and then applies pressure to stabilize the adhesive as the light cures the polymer. The authors demonstrated catheter-mediated application of the photocurable polymer patch in vivo in rat tissue, with minimal inflammation and complete animal survival, as well as in a challenging septal defect in the beating hearts of pigs. The device was also used to seal porcine stomach ulcers and abdominal hernias ex vivo, suggesting versatility of this approach in repairing defects more easily and atraumatically than sutures.A congenital or iatrogenic tissue defect often requires closure by open surgery or metallic components that can erode tissue. Biodegradable, hydrophobic light-activated adhesives represent an attractive alternative to sutures, but lack a specifically designed minimally invasive delivery tool, which limits their clinical translation. We developed a multifunctional, catheter-based technology with no implantable rigid components that functions by unfolding an adhesive-loaded elastic patch and deploying a double-balloon design to stabilize and apply pressure to the patch against the tissue defect site. The device uses a fiber-optic system and reflective metallic coating to uniformly disperse ultraviolet light for adhesive activation. Using this device, we demonstrate closure on the distal side of a defect in porcine abdominal wall, stomach, and heart tissue ex vivo. The catheter was further evaluated as a potential tool for tissue closure in vivo in rat heart and abdomen and as a perventricular tool for closure of a challenging cardiac septal defect in a large animal (porcine) model. Patches attached to the heart and abdominal wall with the device showed similar inflammatory response as sutures, with 100{\%} small animal survival, indicating safety. In the large animal model, a ventricular septal defect in a beating heart was reduced to {\textless}1.6 mm. This new therapeutic platform has utility in a range of clinical scenarios that warrant minimally invasive and atraumatic repair of hard-to-reach defects.},

The assist of the upper limb is important for physically weak persons in daily activities, since upper-limb motion is involved in many important motions in daily living. The most important criterion is that power-assist exoskeletons assist the user's motion automatically in accordance with the user's motion intentions. Electromyogram (EMG) signals in which the user's motion intention is reflected could provide vital real-time information to facilitate accurate control of the power-assist exoskeleton in accordance with the user's motion intentions.

The . Abstract— This paper presents a unified control framework for controlling a quadrotor tail - sitter UAV . The most salient feature of this framework is its capability of uniformly treating the hovering and forward flight , and enabling continuous tran - sition between these two modes , depending on the commanded velocity . The key part of this framework is a nonlinear solver that solves for the proper attitude and thrust that produces the required acceleration set by the position controller in an online fashion . The planned attitude and thrust are then achieved by an inner attitude controller that is global asymptotically stable . To characterize the aircraft aerodynamics , a full envelope wind tunnel test is performed on the full - scale quadrotor tail - sitter UAV . In addition to planning the attitude and thrust required by the position controller , this framework can also be used to analyze the UAV ' s equilibrium state (trimmed condition) , espe - cially when wind gust is present . Finally , simulation results are presented to verify the controller ' s capacity , and experiments are conducted to show the attitude controller ' s performance .},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of older adults living in residential aged care facilities are use wheelchairs or walk with aids. The relationship between using walking aids and falling is somewhat inconsistent and poorly understood. PURPOSE: To investigate the use of walking aids as a risk factor for future falls among older adults living in residential aged care facilities and to identify spatiotemporal gait parameters that mediate the potential relationship between walking aids and falling. METHODS: Forty-three older adults (22 using walking aids and 21 not using walking aids) living in residential aged care facilities were enrolled in this study. Fall history, fear of falling, and the use of psychotropic agents were registered. Spatiotemporal gait (GAITRite(R)), grip strength (Jamar(R)), and cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test) were assessed. Falls were prospectively recorded during a 12-month follow-up period using monthly calendars. RESULTS: Individuals using walking aids were older (P = .012), had a greater fear of falling (P = .017), and demonstrated a more conservative gait pattern compared with those not using walking aids. They walked slower (P {\textless} .001) and had a lower cadence (P {\textless} .001) and shorter step length (P = .018) and step time (P = .003). Twenty-two participants (15 using walking aids vs 7 not using walking aids) reported at least one fall ("fallers"). Univariate logistic regression identified using walking aids as a risk factor for future falls (odds ratio, 3.98; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.10-14.37; P = .035). A lower cadence, increased stance percentage, decreased swing percentage, increased age, and greater psychotropic drug intake were mediators that reduced the odds ratio of the relationship between using walking aids and faller status the most. CONCLUSIONS: Using walking aids is a risk factor for future falls among the older population living in residential settings. A substantial proportion of the relationship between walking aids and future falls could be explained by an altered spatiotemporal gait pattern, increased age, and psychotropic drug intake. This finding supports the aim of extensive training periods and appropriate instructions on the proper use of walking aids in terms of adequate and safe gait patterns.},

Algorithms were developed to calculate the knee flexion angle, stride length and cadence parameters during slow, normal and fast gait speeds. The WMAS was validated for repeatability using a robotic arm and accuracy using the Vicon motion capture system, the gold standard for gait analysis. The WMAS calculated the gait parameters to within a clinically acceptable range and is a powerful tool for gait analysis and potential concussion diagnosis outside of a laboratory setting.},

A combined cognitive and physical feedback of performance is proposed for assisting the skill learning process. Direct contact cooperation has been designed through an adaptive impedance-based controller that adjusts according to the partner's performance in the task. In measuring performance, a scoring system has been designed using the concept of progressive teaching (PT). The system adjusts the difficulty based on the user's number of practices and performance history. Using the proposed method and a baseline constant con-troller, comparative experiments have shown that the PT presents better performance in the initial stage of skill learning. An analysis of the subjects' perception of comfort, peace of mind, and robot performance has shown significant difference at the p{\textless}0.01 level, favoring the PT algorithm.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and performance of a sensor system that was utilized for autonomous navigation of an unmanned ground vehicle. Four different sensor types were integrated to identify obstacles in the vicinity of the vehicle and to identify smooth terrain that could be traversed at speeds up to thirty miles per hour. Two sensors were used for obstacle detection. The first was a Sick LMS200 ladar attached to a spinning shaft with an encoder and a slip ring that transmits range data at a 500 kbaud rate. It creates a 3D representation of the world that is orthogonally projected into a 2D space. The second obstacle detection sensor was a stereo vision system that was manufactured by Videre Design. The system utilized 12.5 mm focal length lenses which provided a horizontal and vertical field of view of 50 degrees and 38 degrees, respectively. Two sensor systems were utilized to evaluate the smoothness of terrain and to identify regions of good traversability. A stationary Sick ladar was mounted to provide range information at a location on a theoretical flat ground-level plane twenty meters in front of the vehicle. Monocular cameras and vision processing algorithms were used as the second sensor system to identify traversable terrain. Here, parts of images that closely resemble the region of the image directly in front of the vehicle were identified. This assumes that the region in front of the vehicle is a traversable path. The paper also describes a sensor fusion approach that was developed whereby the output of all sensors was in a common grid based format. The environment around the vehicle was modeled by a 120×120 grid where each grid cell was 0.5m× 0.5m in size and where the orientation of the grid lines was always maintained parallel to the north-south and east-west lines. Every sensor output an estimate of the traversability of each grid cell. For the three dimensional obstacle avoidance sensors (rotating ladar and stereo vision) the three dimensional point data was projected onto the grid plane. The terrain traversability sensors, i.e. fixed ladar and monocular vision, estimated traversability based on smoothness of the spatial plane fitted to the range data or the commonality in appearance of pixels in the grid cell to those directly in front of the vehicle, respectively},

In this paper, a new method based on the principle of virtual work and a geometry deformation approach is presented for the inverse kinematics model of the STIFF-FLOP arm which is a pneumatically actuated continuum manipulator. We propose a novel simplified and computationally efficient yet accurate analytical solution to analyse the static behaviour of a compound soft manipulator in the presence of external and body forces which is verified against experimental data, showing promising agreement with 10{\%} mean error for planar movements. In the process, we present a new modelling approach for braided soft extensor actuators with no braid-surface relative slip constraint. For the first time, our model predicts a simple analytical solution for the cross section deformation which is essential to control soft manipulators with regional tunable stiffness structure.},

They can also be reconfigured as needed during a surgical procedure. Since CRISP robots are elastic, they will deform when subjected to external forces or other perturbations. In this paper, we explore how to combine sensor information with mechanics-based models for CRISP robots to estimate their shapes under applied loads. The end result is a shape sensing framework for CRISP robots that will enable future research on control under applied loads, autonomous motion, force sensing, and other robot behaviors.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a discrete-time geometric attitude observer for fusing monocular vision with GPS velocity measurements. The observer takes the relative transformations obtained from processing monocular images with any visual odometry algorithm and fuses them with GPS velocity measurements. The objectives of this sensor fusion are twofold; first to mitigate the inherent drift of the attitude estimates of the visual odometry, and second, to estimate the orientation directly with respect to the North-East-Down frame. A key contribution of the paper is to present a rigorous stability analysis showing that the attitude estimates of the observer converge exponentially to the true attitude and to provide a lower bound for the convergence rate of the observer. Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that the observer effectively compensates for the inherent drift of the pure monocular vision based attitude estimation and is able to recover the North-East-Down orientation even if it is initialized with a very large attitude error.},

OctArm V has three sections and, using 8.27 bar of air pressure, the strong proximal section provides 890 N and 250 N of vertical and transverse load capacity, respectively. In addition to the in-lab testing, OctArm V underwent a series of field trials including open-air and in-water field tests. Outcomes of the trials, in which the manipulator demonstrated the ability for adaptive and novel manipulation in challenging environments, are described. OctArm VI is designed and constructed based on the in-lab performance, and the field testing of its predecessors. Implications for the deployment of soft robots in military environments are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on developing a novel approach for measuring body joint angles, mainly the knee angles, for surface electrical stimulator system. In this work, we only focus on the sensing mechanism for measuring the knee joint angle using wearable sensors. Our system consists of multiple flex-sensors mounted on a supportive cloth and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) vibratory gyroscope. In Body Sensor Network (BSN) field for medical purpose, body joint angle measurement system is quite important and useful for continuous monitoring in rehabilitation activities especially for Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients. Body joint angle measurement system is sensory type systems that provide information about angle movement of body joint. It is usually used at knee and arm joint to monitor the movement while patients do some exercises. This very important and helpful for the therapists and physicians in order to see the effectiveness of rehabilitations training. For knee angle movement evaluation, lower limb joint angles and segment angles were estimated by the Kalman filter from the data measured with wireless MEMS vibratory gyroscope and flex-sensors. Electrical stimulation was applied to the common peroneal nerve or the tibialis anterior muscle by detecting stimulus timing automatically from the data of wireless sensor attached at the back of knee which known as popliteal fossa and shank of the paraplegic side. The developed system performed well in monitoring the effectiveness of rehabilitations training with the knee joint angle measurement average error rate of 6.92°. The comparison between measured data of the gyroscope and flex-sensors for knee joint angle measurement system were also demonstrated.},

abstract = {Abstract—The concept of utilizing the Coand˘ a effect to produce stable flight in saucer type Aerial Vehicles (AV) was first conceived in 1935 by Henri Marie Coand˘ a. Coand˘ a's proposed AV design remained a relatively unexplored curiosity for decades until the recent surge in popularity of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) revitalized interest in the topic. Coand˘ a effect UAV offer some distinct advantages over standard multirotors due to their robust frame design, which offers a unique mix of crash resistance, flight safety, and flight performance making them ideal for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications. While much work has been performed in the area of characterization for Coand˘ a surfaces and improved mechanical design of saucer type UAV, little work has been found in the literature discussing stability and attitude control of the platform. This work seeks to contribute to the study of these drones by introducing an approximate servo mapping for desired control effort of a particular prototype, and an experimental control law implemented within the framework of a modified commercially available flight stack.

abstract = {This paper introduces an exoskeleton assistive hand that supports human hand and wrist activities by using user's bioelectric potential to control the exoskeleton movement. The exoskeleton has three active joints for an index finger, three active joints for combination of a middle finger, a ring finger and a little finger and two active joints for a thumb. It also has two passive joints between the index finger part and the combined part of the three fingers. Our proposed poly-articular tendon drive mechanism simulates a mechanical compliance of a human finger so that the exoskeleton could realize comfortable and stable grasping. This paper proposes a new mechanism "dual sensing system" and a new control algorithm "bioelectric potential-based switching control" so that the exoskeleton could synchronize wearer's hand activities without any force sensor. A tendon-driven mechanism and a dual sensing system enable wearer's fingers to move freely when they does need power assist but precise position control or force control. A bioelectric potential-based switching control enables the exoskeleton to augment their grasping force only when wearer's fingers generate a relatively large grasping force. A five-parallel-link mechanism is used to assist wrist activities of a wearer. Through experiments it is confirmed that the exoskeleton does not disturb a wear's pinch of a small object and that it augments grasping force for a heavy work.},

We present an approach that works with a single, compact camera and maintains high classification rates that are robust to changes in illumination. Terrain is classified using a bag of visual words (BOVW) created from speeded up robust features (SURF) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We present several novel techniques to augment this approach. A gradient descent inspired algorithm is used to adjust the SURF Hessian threshold to reach a nominal feature density. A sliding window technique is also used to classify mixed terrain images with high resolution. We demonstrate that our approach is suitable for small legged robots by performing real-time terrain classification on LittleDog. The classifier is used to select between predetermined gaits to traverse terrain of varying difficulty. Results indicate that real-time classification in-the-loop is faster than using a single all-terrain gait.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design of a thumb exoskeleton for pediatric at-home rehabilitation. Pediatric disorders, such as cerebral palsy (CP) and stroke, can result in thumb in palm deformity greatly limiting hand function. This not only limits children's ability to perform activities of daily living but also limits important motor skill development. Specifically, the device, dubbed IOTA (Isolated Orthosis for Thumb Actuation) is a 2-DOF thumb exoskeleton that can actuate the carpometacarpal (CMC) and metacarpalphalangeal (MCP) joints through ranges of motion required for activities of daily living. The device consists of a lightweight hand-mounted mechanism that can be custom secured and aligned to the wearer. The mechanism is actuated via flexible cables that connect to a portable control box. Embedded encoders and bend sensors monitor the two degrees of freedom of the thumb and flexion/extension of the wrist. Using this platform, a number of control modes can be implemented that will enable the device to be intuitively controlled by a patient to assist with opposition grasp, fine motor control, and ultimately facilitate motor recovery. We envision this at-home device augmenting the current in-clinic therapy and enabling tele-rehabilitation where a clinician can remotely monitor a patient's usage and performance.},

abstract = {We proposed three swing leg control policies for spring-mass running robots, inspired by experimental data from our recent collaborative work on ground running birds. Previous investigations suggest that animals may prioritize injury avoidance and/or efficiency as their objective function during running rather than maintaining limit-cycle stability. Therefore, in this study we targeted structural capacity (maximum leg force to avoid damage) and efficiency as the main goals for our control policies, since these objective functions are crucial to reduce motor size and structure weight. Each proposed policy controls the leg angle as a function of time during flight phase such that its objective function during the subsequent stance phase is regulated. The three objective functions that are regulated in the control policies are (i) the leg peak force, (ii) the axial impulse, and (iii) the leg actuator work. It should be noted that each control policy regulates one single objective function. Surprisingly, all three swing leg control policies result in nearly identical subsequent stance phase dynamics. This implies that the implementation of any of the proposed control policies would satisfy both goals (damage avoidance and efficiency) at once. Furthermore, all three control policies require a surprisingly simple leg angle adjustment: leg retraction with constant angular acceleration.},

Our mapping approach fully incorporates the distance sensor measurement uncertainties and the six-dimensional pose covariance of the robot. We introduce a computationally efficient formulation of the map fusion process, which allows for mapping a terrain at high update rates. Finally, our approach is demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot walking over obstacles.},

abstract = {The complexity of soft continuum manipulators with hybrid and tuneable structures poses a challenging task to achieve an inverse kinematics model which is both precise and computationally efficient for control and optimization purposes. In this paper, a new method based on the principle of virtual work and a geometry deformation approach is presented for the inverse kinematics model of the STIFF-FLOP arm which is a pneumatically actuated continuum manipulator. We propose a novel simplified and computationally efficient yet accurate analytical solution to analyse the static behaviour of a compound soft manipulator in the presence of external and body forces which is verified against experimental data, showing promising agreement with 10{\%} mean error for planar movements. In the process, we present a new modelling approach for braided soft extensor actuators with no braid-surface relative slip constraint. For the first time, our model predicts a simple analytical solution for the cross section deformation which is essential to control soft manipulators with regional tunable stiffness structure.},

abstract = {Objective: This report describes the operation of the Bionic Glove, a new functional electrical stimulation (FES) device designed to improve the function of the paralyzed hand after spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke. Design: Signals from a sensor in the glove detecting voluntary wrist movement are used to control FES of muscles either to produce hand grasp or to open the hand. When the glove is donned, conductive areas on its inside surface automatically make contact with self-adhesive electrodes on the skin. Setting and Patients: This report concerns nine people with SCI who have used the device in their daily lives for up to a year or more. Measurements were made at clinics in Edmonton, Miami, and Chicago as part of a multicenter clinical trial. Outcome Measures and Results: The mean peak force of tenodesis grasp in the nine subjects increased from 2.6N (passive) to 11.3N (glove active). Active force was significantly greater than passive grasp force even when muscles were fatigued after repetitive grasp release cycles. Most manual tasks improved significantly with the use of the glove, as judged by the number of tasks completed in a minute or the subjects' qualitative ratings of task difficulty. Conclusion: The Bionic Glove can provide significant improvement of hand function in people with C6-C7 SCI.},

abstract = {Motion analysis has become an important tool for athletes to improve their performance. However, most motion analysis systems are expensive and can only be used in a laboratory environment. Ambulatory motion analysis systems using inertial sensors would allow more flexible use, e.g. in a real training environment or even during competitions. This paper presents the calculation of the flexion-extension knee angle from segment acceleration and angular rates measured using body-worn inertial sensors. Using a functional calibration procedure, the sensors are first aligned without the need of an external camera system. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the relative orientations of thigh and shank, from which the knee angle is calculated. The algorithm was validated by comparing the computed knee angle to the output of a reference camera motion tracking system. In total seven subjects performed five dynamic motions: walking, jogging, running, jumps and squats. The averaged root mean squared error of the estimated knee angle was 8.2 degree (standard deviation 2.4 degree) over all motions, with an average Pearson-correlation of 0.971 (standard deviation 0.020). In the future this will allow the analysis of joint angles during dynamic sports movements.},

abstract = {Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) exhibit inherently compliant behavior due to the elasticity present at the intersection of human tissue and the robot. This compliance, can prominently influence the operation of some SRLs, depending on the application. In order to control the residual vibrations of SRLs, we have used an input-shaping method which is a computationally inexpensive approach. The effectiveness of this method in controlling the residual vibrations of a SRL has been proven using robustness analysis. User studies show that reducing the vibrations using input shaping directly increases the user satisfaction and comfort by at least 9{\%}. It is also observed that 36{\%} of the users preferred unshaped commands. We hypothesize that the shaped commands put a higher cognitive load on the user compared to unshaped commands. This shows that when dealing with human-robot interaction, user satisfaction becomes an equally important parameter as traditional performance criteria and should be taken into account while evaluating the success of any vibration-control method.},

abstract = {While building maps when robot poses are known is a tractable problem requiring limited computational complexity, the simultaneous estimation of the trajectory and the map of the environment (known as SLAM) is much more complex and requires many computational resources. Moreover, SLAM is generally peformed in environments that do not vary over time (called static environments), whereas real applications commonly require navigation services in changing environments (called dynamic environments). Many real robotic applications require updated maps of the environment that vary over time, starting from a given known initial condition. In this context classical SLAM approaches are generally not directly applicable: such approaches only apply in static environments or in dynamic environments where it is possible to model the environment dynamics. We are interested here in long-term mapping operativity in presence of variations in the map, as in the case of robotic applications in logistic spaces, where rovers have to track the presence of goods in given areas. In this paper we propose a methodology that is able to detect variations in the environment, generate a local map containing only the persistent variations and finally merge the local map with the global one used for localization.},

abstract = {Understanding the environment is a key requirement for any autonomous robot operation. There is extensive research on mapping geometric structure and perceiving objects. However, the environment is also defined by the movement patterns in it. Information about human motion patterns can, e.g., lead to safer and socially more acceptable robot trajectories. Airflow pattern information allow to plan energy efficient paths for flying robots and improve gas distribution mapping. However, modeling the motion of objects (e.g., people) and flow of continuous media (e.g., air) is a challenging task. We present a probabilistic approach for general flow mapping, which can readily handle both of these examples. Moreover, we present and compare two data imputation methods allowing to build dense maps from sparsely distributed measurements. The methods are evaluated using two different data sets: one with pedestrian data and one with wind measurements. Our results show that it is possible to accurately represent multimodal, turbulent flow using a set of Gaussian Mixture Models, and also to reconstruct a dense representation based on sparsely distributed locations.},

Although soft actuators have allowed for a variety of innovative applications, there is a need for design tools that can help to efficiently and systematically design actuators for particular functions. Mathematical modeling of soft actuators is an area that is still in its infancy but has the potential to provide quantitative insights into the response of the actuators. These insights can be used to guide actuator design, thus accelerating the design process. Here, we study fluid-powered fiber-reinforced actuators, because these have previously been shown to be capable of producing a wide range of motions. We present a design strategy that takes a kinematic trajectory as its input and uses analytical modeling based on nonlinear elasticity and optimization to identify the optimal design parameters for an actuator that will follow this trajectory upon pressurization. We experimentally verify our modeling approach, and finally we demonstrate how the strategy works, by designing actuators that replicate the motion of the index finger and thumb.},

abstract = {As we all know, rigid structure is the universal form of robots. They can be controlled accurately, but are not suitable enough for applying in rehabilitation, especially for hands. Human's hands have some complicated patterns of movement and narrow joint range of motion, so rigid accessory equipment may cause secondary injury. For the purpose of avoiding this potential risk, the idea of applying soft structure to hand rehabilitation robot is presented in this paper. The soft robot is a new research direction in the field of robot industry, especially in rehabilitation. The soft actuator we presented is made of liquid silicone and thread, and can be tied to the back of human's hands. When it is inflated or deflated, a bending and stretching motion of hands follow with the deformation of soft actuators. It works by deforming repeatedly. The soft actuator has some advantages such as portable, lightweight, low-cost, safe, low-impedance and so on. It works well by the cooperation of vacuum pump which can provide incessant air and solenoid valve which is used for reversing. In the whole system, force sensing resistor and bending sensor are used in the experiments. In order to prove that the soft actuator can work smoothly, we had a test to explore the relationship between air inflow and bending angle. The result that their relationship is close to a straight line means controlling easily and working well. Beacons of these advantages the soft robots have, a wide application prospect in rehabilitation or other fields is available.},

abstract = {The impressive manipulation capabilities of the human hand are undoubtedly related to the thumb opposition. Such a versatility is highly desirable in the context of humanoid robots, in particular when performing object manipulation. Biomechanical data, surgery procedures and rehabilitation surveys represent an excellent base from which a robotic design can be inferred. This knowledge must be understood to identify the properties required for manipulation skills, and especially, to obtain a holistic view of the thumb functionality. Several designs have been realized, that concentrated on biomimetism or on classical mechanism designs. Therefore, it is currently difficult for designers to obtain a clear overview of the properties required for a functional robot thumb. In the present case, a robotic hand with size, forces, velocity and shape comparable to the human ones, is envisioned. Unlike most of robotic designs-where the fingers are modular and the thumb is simply a finger placed in opposition-the thumb benefits from an intensive functional analysis. This paper gathers anatomy, surgery and rehabilitation data and identifies the properties required for human like manipulation. Based on this synergy, guidelines are presented that are fused and applied to the hand design of the Integrated Hand arm project of DLR.},

The collapse begins from a curvature singularity with infinite mass and size on an inhomogeneous space–time background. The collapse is found to proceed without formation of an even horizon to singularity when the collapsing configuration radiates all its mass energy. The impact of inhomogeneity on various parameters of the collapsing stellar configuration is examined in some specific space–time backgrounds.},

abstract = {Water, food and energy are at the core of human needs and there is a boundless complex cycle among these three basic human needs. Ecosystems are in the center of this nexus, since they contribute to the provision of each component, making it imperative to understand the role of ecosystems in securing food, water and energy for human well-being. In this study we aimed to map and assess water provisioning services and associated benefits to support the ecosystem-water-food-energy nexus by taking into account environmental flow requirements for riverine ecosystems using the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We developed a framework that includes indicators of renewable water (capacity of ecosystem to provide water) and water use (service flow) and we applied it in the Danube river basin over the period 1995-2004. Water scarcity indicators were used to map the possible water scarcity in the subbasins, and analyze the spatial match of water availability and water use. The results show that modelling is instrumental to perform the integrated analysis of the ecosystem-water-food-energy nexus; and that spatial mapping is a powerful tool to display environmental availability of water provisioning and regulatory services delivered by ecosystems, and can support the nexus analysis.},

abstract = {We address one of the main challenges towards autonomous quadrotor flight in complex environments, which is flight through narrow gaps. While previous works relied on off-board localization systems or on accurate prior knowledge of the gap position and orientation, we rely solely on onboard sensing and computing and estimate the full state by fusing gap detection from a single onboard camera with an IMU. This problem is challenging for two reasons: (i) the quadrotor pose uncertainty with respect to the gap increases quadratically with the distance from the gap; (ii) the quadrotor has to actively control its orientation towards the gap to enable state estimation (i.e., active vision). We solve this problem by generating a trajectory that considers geometric, dynamic, and perception constraints: during the approach maneuver, the quadrotor always faces the gap to allow state estimation, while respecting the vehicle dynamics; during the traverse through the gap, the distance of the quadrotor to the edges of the gap is maximized. Furthermore, we replan the trajectory during its execution to cope with the varying uncertainty of the state estimate. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate the proposed approach in many real experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses and achieves autonomous, aggressive flight through narrow gaps using only onboard sensing and computing and without prior knowledge of the pose of the gap.},

The adopted approach harnesses the deformation property of an elastomeric material to relate applied force to measurable deformation. A lightweight, robust and compact magnetic-field based sensing system, consisting of an assembly of miniature hall-effect sensors, is employed to infer the positional information of a magnet embedded in the elastomeric material. Instead of solving two non-linear models (magnetic field and elastomeric) sequentially, a direct approach of using artificial neural networks (ANN) is utilized to relate magnetic flux density (MFD) measurements to applied forces. The force sensor, which weighs only 24.5 gms, provides a measurement range of 0 - 1000 N normal to the ground and up to ± 125N parallel to the ground. The mean force measurement accuracy was found to be within 7{\%} of the applied forces. The sensor designed as part of this work finds direct applications in ground reaction force sensing for a running quadrupedal robot.},

The utility of the sensor integration is demon-strated by using the actuator to distinguish successful grasps amongst a set of common cylindrical objects with varying diameter. The grasp radius is estimated from the relationship between the sensor pair.

abstract = {Finding feasible, collision-free paths for multiagent systems can be challenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's intent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time efficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring agents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work presents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a novel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads the online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline learning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint configuration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value network not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for finding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in the other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26 percent improvement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy.},

abstract = {Finite Element analysis can provide accurate deformable models for soft-robots. However, using such models is very difficult in a real-time system of control. In this paper, we introduce a generic solution that enables a high-rate control and that is compatible with strong real-time constraints. From a Finite Element analysis, computed at low rate, an inverse model of the robot outputs the setpoint values for the actuator in order to obtain a desired trajectory. This inverse problem uses a QP (quadratic-programming) algorithm based on the equations set by the Finite Element Method. To improve the update rate performances, we propose an asynchronous simulation framework that provides a better trade-off between the deformation accuracy and the computational burden. Complex computations such as accurate FEM deformations are done at low frequency while the control is performed at high frequency with strong real-time constraints. The two simulation loops (high frequency and low frequency loops) are mechanically coupled in order to guarantee mechanical accuracy of the system over time. Finally, the validity of the multi-rate simulation is discussed based on measurements of the evolution in the QP matrix and an experimental validation is conducted to validate the correctness of the high-rate inverse model on a real robot.},

abstract = {Background. At 6 months poststroke, most patients cannot incorporate their affected hand into daily activities, which in turn is likely to reduce their perceived quality of life. Objective. This preliminary study explored change in patient-reported, health-related quality of life associated with robotic-assisted therapy combined with reduced therapist-supervised training. Design and Setting. A single-blind, multi-site, randomized clinical trial was conducted. Participants. Seventeen individuals who were 3 to 9 months poststroke participated. Intervention. Sixty hours of therapist-supervised repetitive task practice (RTP) was compared with 30 hours of RTP combined with 30 hours of robotic-assisted therapy. Measurements. Participants completed the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 2 months postintervention. Change in SIS score domains was assessed in a mixed model analysis. Results. The combined therapy group had a greater increase in rating of mood from preintervention to postintervention, and the RTP-only group had a greater increase in rating of social participation from preintervention to follow-up. Both groups had statistically significant improvement in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living scores from preintervention to postintervention, Both groups reported significant improvement in hand function postintervention and at follow-up, and the magnitude of these changes suggested clinical significance. The combined therapy group had significant improvements in stroke recovery rating postintervention and at follow-up, which appeared clinically significant; this also was true for stroke recovery rating from preintervention to follow-up in the RTP-only group. Limitations. Outcomes of 30 hours of RTP in the absence of robotic-assisted therapy remain unknown. Conclusion. Robotic-assisted therapy may be an effective alternative or adjunct to the delivery of intensive task practice interventions to enhance hand function recovery in patients with stroke},

abstract = {The importance of evaluation of an orthopedic operation such as hip or knee arthroplasty$\backslash$r$\backslash$nhas long been recognized. Many definitions of outcome and scoring questionnaires have$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbeen used in the past to assess the outcome of joint replacement. However, these assessments$\backslash$r$\backslash$nare subjective and not accurate enough. In addition, orthopedic surgeons$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrequire now more subtle comparisons between potentially efficacious treatments (e.g. two$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntypes of prostheses). Therefore, the use of objective instruments that have a better$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsensitivity and specificity than traditional scoring systems is needed. Gait analysis is one$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof the most currently used instrumented techniques in this respect. However, a gait$\backslash$r$\backslash$nanalysis system is accessible only in a few specialized laboratories, as it is complex,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexpensive, need a lot of room space and fixed devices, and not convenient for the patient.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn this thesis, we proposed an ambulatory system based on kinematic sensors attached$\backslash$r$\backslash$non the lower limbs to overcome the limitations of the previously mentioned techniques.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTechnically the device is portable, easily mountable, non-invasive, and capable of continuously$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrecording data in long term without hindrance to natural gait. The goal was to$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprovide gait parameters as a new objective method to assess Total Knee Replacement$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(TKR). New solutions to fusing the data of accelerometers and gyroscopes were proposed$\backslash$r$\backslash$nto accurately measure lower limbs orientations and joint angles. The methods propose a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nminimal sensor configuration with one sensor module mounted on each segment. The$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmodels consider anatomical aspects and biomechanical constraints. In the proposed$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntechniques, the angles are found without the need for integration, so absolute angles can$\backslash$r$\backslash$nbe obtained which are free from any source of drift. These data were then used to develop$\backslash$r$\backslash$na gait analysis system providing spatio-temporal parameters, kinematic curves, and a$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvisualization tool to animate the motion data as synthetic skeletons performing the same$\backslash$r$\backslash$nactions as the subjects. Moreover, a new algorithm was proposed for assessing and$\backslash$r$\backslash$nquantification of inter-joint coordination during gait. The coordination model captures$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe whole dynamics of the lower limbs movements and shows the kinematic synergies at$\backslash$r$\backslash$nvarious walking speeds. The model imposes a relationship among lower limb joint angles$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(hips and knees) to parameterize the dynamics of locomotion for each individual. It$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprovides a coordination score at various walking speeds which is ranged between 0 and$\backslash$r$\backslash$n10. An integration of different analysis tools such as Harmonic Analysis, Principal Com-$\backslash$r$\backslash$nii$\backslash$r$\backslash$nponent Analysis, and Artificial Neural Network helped overcome high-dimensionality,$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntemporal dependence, and non-linear relationships of the gait patterns.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIn order to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in outcome evaluation, we$\backslash$r$\backslash$nhave considered a clinical study where the outcomes of two types of knee prostheses were$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncompared. We conducted a randomized controlled study, including 54 patients, to assess$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTKR outcome between patients with fixed bearing and mobile bearing tibial plates of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nimplants. The patients were tested preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmonths, 6 months, and 1 year. Various statistical analyses were done to compare the$\backslash$r$\backslash$noutcomes of the two groups. Finally, we provided objective criteria, using ambulatory gait$\backslash$r$\backslash$nanalysis, for assessing functional recovery following TKR procedure. We showed significant$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifference between the two groups where the standard clinical evaluation was$\backslash$r$\backslash$nunable to detect such a difference. },

abstract = {Conventional urban water management practices aim to meet water supply-demands while conveying wastewater and stormwater away from urban settings. Alternative approaches which consider water demands to be manageable and wastewater and stormwater as valuable resources, although being increasingly sought, lack reliable site specific implementation methodologies. This paper describes the development of a decision support tool (termed the Urban Water Optioneering Tool (UWOT)) to facilitate the selection of combinations of water saving strategies and technologies and to support the delivery of integrated, sustainable water management for new developments. The tool is based on a water balance model which allows the investigation of interactions between the major urban water cycle streams. The??model is informed by a knowledge library which is populated with technological options and information on their major characteristics and performance. The technology selection is driven by a GA algorithm allowing efficient exploration of the decision space. Quantitative and qualitative sustainability criteria and indicators are used to compare between alternative composite water management strategies while preserving the multiobjective nature of the problem. The tool has been successfully tested on??a case study site in the UK, and the results are presented and discussed. It is suggested that "optioneering" tools will increasingly become part of urban water management planning toolkits as practice moves towards more decentralised, integrated, context-specific solutions to address issues of sustainability. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Model-based reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling an agent to learn to predict the effects of its actions, which could provide flexible predictive models for a wide range of tasks and environments, without detailed human supervision. We develop a method for combining deep action-conditioned video prediction models with model-predictive control that uses entirely unlabeled training data. Our approach does not require a calibrated camera, an instrumented training set-up, nor precise sensing and actuation. Our results show that our method enables a real robot to perform nonprehensile manipulation -- pushing objects -- and can handle novel objects not seen during training.},

The local measurements are then integrated into a global map for noise filtering and map refinement. The global map obtained is able to support navigation and obstacle avoidance for aerial robots through our indoor and outdoor experimental verification.

Due to large number of experiences required for training, most of these approaches use a self-supervised paradigm: using sensors to measure success/failure. However, in most cases, these sensors provide weak supervision at best. In this work, we propose an adversarial learning framework that pits an adversary against the robot learning the task. In an effort to defeat the adversary, the original robot learns to perform the task with more robustness leading to overall improved performance. We show that this adversarial framework forces the the robot to learn a better grasping model in order to overcome the adversary. By grasping 82{\%} of presented novel objects compared to 68{\%} without an adversary, we demonstrate the utility of creating adversaries. We also demonstrate via experiments that having robots in adversarial setting might be a better learning strategy as compared to having collaborative multiple robots.},

abstract = {—Manipulation of micrometer to millimeter-scale ob-jects is central to biotechnological and medical applications involv-ing small-scale robotic devices. Mobile untethered microgrippers have been developed, which use magnetic fields for motion and activation of grasping. This letter extends the capabilities of such microgrippers by presenting the first example of reliable and au-tonomous three-dimensional (3-D) micrograsping and cargo deliv-ery of a microgripper using simple control strategies. This endeavor will allow microgrippers to reliably grasp and transfer microob-jects, such as cells, with minimal user input, which is ideal for cooperative tasks performed by multiple microgrippers in future work. The proposed controller autonomously manipulates a 3-D magnetic microgripper for pick-and-place tasks in the 3-D space. By regulating the remotely applied force on the microgripper, the 3-D position and velocity of the microgripper are controlled, and the microgripper grasping, i.e., opening and closing, is determined by the magnetic field strength. In experiments, the microgripper successfully grasps cargoes with cubic, irregular, triangular, and beam shapes using at most 5, 8, 20, and 24 attempts, respectively. The microgripper shown here demonstrates fast grasping due to their complete magnetic actuation method. Moreover, a prelimi-nary cell viability test suggests that the microgripper has no adverse effects on living cells.

abstract = {Creating 3D maps on robots and other mobile devices has become a reality in recent years. Online 3D reconstruction enables many exciting applications in robotics and AR/VR gaming. However, the reconstructions are noisy and generally incomplete. Moreover, during onine reconstruction, the surface changes with every newly integrated depth image which poses a significant challenge for physics engines and path planning algorithms. This paper presents a novel, fast and robust method for obtaining and using information about planar surfaces, such as walls, floors, and ceilings as a stage in 3D reconstruction based on Signed Distance Fields. Our algorithm recovers clean and accurate surfaces, reduces the movement of individual mesh vertices caused by noise during online reconstruction and fills in the occluded and unobserved regions. We implemented and evaluated two different strategies to generate plane candidates and two strategies for merging them. Our implementation is optimized to run in real-time on mobile devices such as the Tango tablet. In an extensive set of experiments, we validated that our approach works well in a large number of natural environments despite the presence of significant amount of occlusion, clutter and noise, which occur frequently. We further show that plane fitting enables in many cases a meaningful semantic segmentation of real-world scenes.},

In this paper, we determine the complexity of the structure and motion with a few parameters calculated using information theory. Depending on this complexity and the desired performance metrics, suitable parameters are explored and determined. Additionally, based on the proposed structure and motion parameters, several applications are presented, including a novel active SLAM approach which guides the camera in such a way that the SLAM algorithm achieves the desired performance met-rics. Real-world and simulated experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design space and its applications.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on linear systems. A system is defined as a set of rules that associates an output time function to every input time function. The input is f(t) or source signal to the system, and g(t) is the output or response signal because of this input. The actual physical structure of the system determines the exact relationship between f(t) and g(t). In the special case of a two terminal electrical network, f(t) can be a sinusoidal voltage across the two terminals and g(t) can be the current flowing into one of the terminals and out of the other because of this impressed voltage. In this case, the relationship between f(t) and g(t) is the familiar complex impedance between the two terminals of the network. A system is said to obey superposition if the output of a sum of inputs is equal to the sum of the corresponding individual outputs. A system is said to be time invariant if the response of an input is not dependent upon the actual time of occurrence of the input. That is, a time shift in input signal causes an equal time shift in the output waveform.},

Existing solutions for deep sea robotic manipulation have historically been driven by the oil industry, resulting in destructive interactions with undersea life. Soft material robotics relies on compliant materials that are inherently impedance matched to natural environments and to soft or fragile organisms. We demonstrate design principles for soft robot end effectors, bench-top characterization of their grasping performance, and conclude by describing in situ testing at mesophotic depths. The result is the first use of soft robotics in the deep sea for the nondestructive sampling of benthic fauna.},

@article{Agarwal2016b,
abstract = {The SLAM problem is known to have a special property that when robot orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver.},

Our method can effectively deal with typical distortions affecting SLAMgenerated maps. Traditional map merging techniques that use a single rigid body transformation to relate the reference frames of different maps. Instead, our approach achieves more accurate results by eliminating the inconsistencies resulting from distortions affecting the inputs, and can succeed in those situations where traditional approaches fail for substantial deformations. The core idea behind our solution is to localize the robot in a reference map by using the data from another map as observations. We validated our approach on publicly available datasets, and provide quantitative results that confirm its effectiveness on challenging instances of the merging problem.},

abstract = {Sustainable urban water management (SUWM) requires an integrated, adaptive, coordinated and participatory approach. Current urban water policies are beginning to reflect this understanding yet the rhetoric is often not translated to implementation. Despite the 'new' philosophy, urban water management remains a complex and fragmented area relying on traditional, technical, linear management approaches. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the barriers to change, there has been little systematic review of what constitutes the scope of such barriers and how these should be addressed to advance SUWM. To better understand why implementation fails to occur beyond ad hoc project interventions, an extensive literature review of observed and studied barriers was conducted. Drawing on local, national and international literature from the field of integrated urban water management and other similar fields, 53 studies were assessed, resulting in a typology of 12 barrier types. The analysis revealed the barriers are largely socio-institutional rather than technical, reflecting issues related to community, resources, responsibility, knowledge, vision, commitment and coordination. Furthermore, the meta-analysis demonstrated a paucity of targeted strategies for overcoming the stated institutional barriers. Evaluation of the typology in relation to capacity building suggests that these systemic issues require a sophisticated programme of change that focuses on fostering social capital, inter-sectoral professional development, and inter-organisational coordination.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the combination of our soft supernumerary robotic finger i.e. Soft-SixthFinger with a commercially available zero gravity arm support, the SaeboMAS. The overall proposed system can provide the needed assistance during paretic upper limb rehabilitation involving both grasping and arm mobility to solve task-oriented activities. The Soft-SixthFinger is a wearable robotic supernumerary finger designed to be used as an active assistive device by post stroke patients to compensate the paretic hand grasp. The device works jointly with the paretic hand/arm to grasp an object similarly to the two parts of a robotic gripper. The SaeboMAS is a commercially available mobile arm support to neutralize gravity effects on the paretic arm specifically designed to facilitate and challenge the weakened shoulder muscles during functional tasks. The proposed system has been designed to be used during the rehabilitation phase when the arm is potentially able to recover its functionality, but the hand is still not able to perform a grasp due to the lack of an efficient thumb opposition. The overall system also act as a motivation tool for the patients to perform task-oriented rehabilitation activities. With the aid of proposed system, the patient can closely simulate the desired motion with the non-functional arm for rehabilitation purposes, while performing a grasp with the help of the Soft-SixthFinger. As a pilot study we tested the proposed system with a chronic stroke patient to evaluate how the mobile arm support in conjunction with a robotic supernumerary finger can help in performing the tasks requiring the manipulation of grasped object through the paretic arm. In particular, we performed the Frenchay Arm Test (FAT) and Box and Block Test (BBT). The proposed system successfully enabled the patient to complete tasks which were previously impossible to perform.},

abstract = {???The paper reviews a recent development in soft robotics.???Soft materials in animals inspire a new wave of robotics.???Current enabling technologies in soft robotics and challenges are discussed.???Potential convergence between soft robotics and tissue engineering is introduced. Animals exploit soft structures to move effectively in complex natural environments. These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. The goal is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural environments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The design is inspired by the biological musculoskeletal system of the human foot and lower leg, mimicking the morphology and the functionality of the biological muscle-tendon-ligament structure. A key feature of the device is its soft structure that provides active assistance without restricting natural degrees of freedom at the ankle joint. Four pneumatic artificial muscles assist dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as inversion and eversion. The prototype is also equipped with various embedded sensors for gait pattern analysis. For the subject tested, the prototype is capable of generating an ankle range of motion of 27° (14° dorsiflexion and 13° plantarflexion). The controllability of the system is experimentally demonstrated using a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller. The controller is found using an identified LTI model of the system, resulting from the interaction of the soft orthotic device with a human leg, and model-based classical control design techniques. The suitability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated with several angle-reference following experiments.},

The platform comprises small autonomous vehicles (" Duckiebots ") built from off-the-shelf components, and cities (" Duckietowns ") complete with roads, signage, traffic lights, obstacles, and citizens (duck-ies) in need of transportation. The advantage of the Duckietown platform is the combination of its low cost with its large range of functionalities. A Duckiebot senses the world with only one monocular camera and performs all processing onboard with a Raspberri Pi 2, yet it is able to: follow lanes while avoiding obstacles, pedestrians (duckies) and other Duckiebots; localize within a global map; navigate a city; and coordinate with other Duckiebots to avoid collisions. Duckietown is a useful tool for education, since institutions can save money and time by not having to develop all of the supporting infrastructure and capabilities that are tangential to the desired course material. All materials are available as open source, and the hope is that others in the community will adopt the platform for education and research. Four other institutions have used Duckietown to date.},

abstract = {— Pushing is present in some form or other in most manipulation tasks and becomes crucial when dealing with objects that are non-graspable or too heavy to lift. In previous work [1] we showed that pushing can have an important stochastic component. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to model planar pushing interaction to predict both the most likely outcome of a push and its expected variability. The learned models rely on a variation of Gaussian Processes with input-dependent noise called variational heteroscedastic Gaussian processes (VHGP) [2]. We show that we can learn accurate models that outperform analytical models after less than 100 samples and saturate in performance with less than 1000 samples. We validate the results against a collected dataset of repeated trajectories, and use the learned models to study questions such as the nature of the variability in pushing, and the validity of the quasi-static assumption. I. INTRODUCTION Pushing is a manipulation primitive that extends the versa-tility of manipulation systems, for example by moving heavy or non-graspable objects. It is also a central element in more complex manipulation tasks such as scooping or grasping. Planar pushing has been studied in depth in the mechan-ics and robotics communities. However assumptions and approximations are necessary to yield reasonable solutions. The most frequent assumptions considered in these models are quasi-static interaction, Coulomb's friction and uniform distribution between the object and the surface. Another underlying assumption of all these models is that pushing is a deterministic process. While we do not question the deterministic vs. stochastic nature of physical phenomena, in previous work [1] we provided empirical evidence of the observable variability in the outcome of a push. Figure 1 shows an example of three identical pushes that yield three significantly different and divergent outcomes of the pushed object. In this paper, we use data from prior work [1] to explore how to learn models for pushing to overcome these assump-tions. In particular we are interested in studying the ability to learn models that capture the most likely outcome of a push and the expected variability. Gaussian Processes have become widely used in robotics for supervised non-parametric regression. They provide a tool to reliably learn complex functions from noisy data. The noise of the process is assumed to be Gaussian and constant over the input space. For the case of pushing, however, we show that constant input noise does not reflect reality. Different pushes will lead to different amounts of variability in the outocme of a push. It is more appropriate then to},

abstract = {This paper presents a robotic manipulation system capable of autonomously positioning a multi-segment soft fluidic elastomer robot in three dimensions. Specifically, we present an extremely soft robotic manipulator morphology that is composed entirely from low durometer elastomer, powered by pressurized air, and designed to be both modular and durable. To understand the deformation of a single arm segment, we develop and experimentally validate a static deformation model. Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot's spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator's configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

abstract = {A new method of estimating lower limbs orientations using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes is presented. The model is based on estimating the accelerations of ankle and knee joints by placing virtual sensors at the centers of rotation. The proposed technique considers human locomotion and biomechanical constraints, and provides a solution to fusing the data of gyroscopes and accelerometers that yields stable and drift-free estimates of segment orientation. The method was validated by measuring lower limb motions of eight subjects, walking at three different speeds, and comparing the results with a reference motion measurement system. The results are very close to those of the reference system presenting very small errors (Shank: rms = 1.0, Thigh: rms = 1.6 degrees) and excellent correlation coefficients (Shank: r = 0.999, Thigh: r = 0.998). Technically, the proposed ambulatory system is portable, easily mountable, and can be used for long-term monitoring without hindrance to natural activities. Finally, a gait analysis tool was designed to visualize the motion data as synthetic skeletons performing the same actions as the subjects.},

Nevertheless, their use in industry and services is currently limited in scope. Quadrupedal Locomotion: An Introduction to the Control of Four-legged Robots brings together some of the methods and techniques in this emerging field that have recently been developed in an effort to deal with the problems that currently prevent legged robots being more widely used for real applications. Quadrupedal Locomotion: An Introduction to the Control of Four-legged Robots illustrates the appropriate algorithms and methods through a discussion of simulation and experiments that have been tested on a real machine, the SILO4 walking robot. Data from the experiments can be found on-line at http://www.iai.csic.es/users/silo4/. This book is divided into two parts: the first part, Walking Measurements and Algorithms, introduces the historical development of quadrupeds, their advantages/disadvantages and potential uses, and the trade-off between quadrupeds and hexapods. The second part, Control Techniques, concentrates on general techniques that have been specifically applied to legged robots, including kinematic and dynamic models, soft computing techniques to increase speed, virtual sensors that help reduce the electronic burden of the machine, and software simulators to study and test certain robot properties. As the first book to focus specifically on quadrupeds, Quadrupedal Locomotion: An Introduction to the Control of Four-legged Robots will be suitable for researchers, postgraduates and senior undergraduates in the field of robotics as well as engineers working in industry.},

Using preoperative images, these robots can be designed to optimize a procedure for a particular patient. To minimize invasiveness and maximize biocompatibility, the actuation units of flexible medical robots should be placed fully outside the patient's body. In this paper, we present a novel, compact, lightweight, modular actuation and control system for driving a class of these flexible robots, known as concentric tube robots. A key feature of the design is the use of 3D printed waffle gears to enable compact control of two degrees of freedom within each module. We measure the precision and accuracy of a single actuation module and demonstrate the ability of an integrated set of three actuation modules to control six degrees of freedom. The integrated system drives a three-tube concentric tube robot to reach a final tip position that is on average less than 2 mm from a given target. In addition, we show a handheld manifestation of the device and present its potential applications.},

Our algorithm uses a combination of global viewpoint selection and evolutionary optimization to refine the planned trajectory in continuous 3D space while satisfying dynamic constraints. Our approach is evaluated on the application of weed detection for precision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland using an occupancy grid and generate adaptive plans according to information-theoretic objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We validate our approach in simulation by comparing against existing methods, and study the effects of different planning strategies. Our results show that the proposed algorithm builds maps with over 50{\%} lower entropy compared to traditional "lawnmower" coverage in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the planning scheme on a multirotor platform with different artificial farmland set-ups.},

Using the resulting material properties, numerical simulations of pleated actuator architectures are analyzed to reduce stress concentration and increase actuation amplitudes.

Neither the Ritchie index nor the SROMP measurements correlated significantly with subluxation. Although the measurements used in this study were reliable, they did not support the association of shoulder subluxation with shoulder pain in stroke patients.

The kinematic relation between the device joint angles and the corresponding finger joint angles is simple which greatly simplifies the high level motion control. As the motor capability of patients may be different and the range of motion of the finger may change along with the rehabilitation progress, it is important to take the changes into consideration.

@article{Leeuwen1997,
abstract = {This paper offers a quantitative analysis of tentacle extension in squid that integrates several levels of structural organization. The muscular stalks of the two tentacles of squid are rapidly elongated by 70 per cent of resting length during prey capture. A typical duration of the extension is 30 ms in Loligo pealei (with a contracted tentacle length of 93 mm and a strike distance of about 37 mm). In a successful strike, the terminal clubs hit the prey and attach to it via arrays of suckers. A forward dynamics model is proposed for the extension of the tentacular stalk and the forward motion of the terminal club. The stalk is modelled as a longitudinal array of thin muscular discs with extensor muscle fibres oriented parallel to the disc planes. As a disc contracts radially, it lengthens because its volume is constant. The equations of motion for the linked system of discs were formulated and solved numerically. The inputs of the model are the dimensions of the tentacle, passive and active muscle properties such as Hill's force–velocity relationship, myofilament lengths and activation of the muscle fibres. The model predicts the changing geometry of the tentacle, the pressure and stress distribution inside the tentacle and the velocity and kinetic energy distribution of the stalk and club. These predictions are in agreement with kinematic observations from high-speed films of prey capture. The model demonstrates also that the unusually short myosin filaments (reported range 0.5–0.9 micrometre) that characterize the extensor muscles are necessary for the observed extension performance. Myosin filament lengths typical for vertebrate sarcomeres (1.58 micrometre) would lead to a significant reduction in performance. In addition, the model predicts that, to maximize peak velocity of the terminal club, the myosin filaments should be longer at the base and shorter at the tip of the stalk (0.97 micrometre at the base and 0.50 micrometre at the tip for the tentacle size above). This results from differences in dynamic loading along the stalk. Finally, the model allows exploration of the effects of changes in the dimensions and mass of the tentacle and intrinsic speed of the myofilaments on the optimum myosin filament lengths.},

With the trained network we can segment proposed paths and obstacles at run-time using a vehicle equipped with only a monocular camera without relying on explicit modelling of road or lane markings. We evaluate our method on the large-scale KITTI and Oxford RobotCar datasets and demonstrate reliable path proposal and obstacle segmentation in a wide variety of environments under a range of lighting, weather and traffic conditions. We illustrate how the method can generalise to multiple path proposals at intersections and outline plans to incorporate the system into a framework for autonomous urban driving.},

have the advantage that the systems are simple and are easy to handle.
When a mobile robot is navigated using an ultrasonic sensor, the map of
the environment should include information about the reflection
characteristics of objects. For this purpose, the map using a vector
expression is better than a grid map. In this paper, an environment
reconstruction method using a vector map is proposed. In this method,
the environment is reconstructed from the data obtained by using our
novel ultrasonic sensor which can measure the normal direction of walls,
and the next sensing point is determined automatically. The experimental
results of a map construction using this algorithm are shown. As a
result of the experiments, it is found that the measurement of walls is
possible using this method and the effectiveness of the planning
algorithm for the sensing point is verified},

abstract = {Abstract This article describes new opportunities in soft robotics and some potential avenues to overcome challenges associated with the realization of these opportunities. New opportunities include new applications that exploit novel amorphous nonrigid dynamics, a new design space due to the elimination of traditional manufacturing constraints, more opportunities for modeling and mimicry of natural systems, and increased safety and mechanical compatibility with humans. Challenges include limited simulation and design automation tools, lack of soft actuation methods, and difficulty in manufacturing and component standardization. Both computational (e.g., evolutionary design tools) and mechanical (porous and jamming materials) approaches are proposed to alleviate these needs.},

abstract = {Mice are one of the most commonly used laboratory animals, with an extensive array of disease models in existence, including for many neuromuscular diseases. The hindlimb is of particular interest due to several close muscle analogues/homologues to humans and other species. A detailed anatomical study describing the adult morphology is lacking, however. This study describes in detail the musculoskeletal geometry and skeletal muscle architecture of the mouse hindlimb and pelvis, determining the extent to which the muscles are adapted for their function, as inferred from their architecture. Using I2KI enhanced microCT scanning and digital segmentation, it was possible to identify 39 distinct muscles of the hindlimb and pelvis belonging to nine functional groups. The architecture of each of these muscles was determined through microdissections, revealing strong architectural specialisations between the functional groups. The hip extensors and hip adductors showed significantly stronger adaptations towards high contraction velocities and joint control relative to the distal functional groups, which exhibited larger physiological cross sectional areas and longer tendons, adaptations for high force output and elastic energy savings. These results suggest that a proximo-distal gradient in muscle architecture exists in the mouse hindlimb. Such a gradient has been purported to function in aiding locomotor stability and efficiency. The data presented here will be especially valuable to any research with a focus on the architecture or gross anatomy of the mouse hindlimb and pelvis musculature, but also of use to anyone interested in the functional significance of muscle design in relation to quadrupedal locomotion.},

abstract = {Action parsing in videos with complex scenes is an interesting but challenging task in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a generic 3D convolutional neural network in a multi-task learning manner for effective Deep Action Parsing (DAP3D-Net) in videos. Particularly, in the training phase, action localization, classification and attributes learning can be jointly optimized on our appearancemotion data via DAP3D-Net. For an upcoming test video, we can describe each individual action in the video simultaneously as: Where the action occurs, What the action is and How the action is performed. To well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DAP3D-Net, we also contribute a new Numerous-category Aligned Synthetic Action dataset, i.e., NASA, which consists of 200; 000 action clips of more than 300 categories and with 33 pre-defined action attributes in two hierarchical levels (i.e., low-level attributes of basic body part movements and high-level attributes related to action motion). We learn DAP3D-Net using the NASA dataset and then evaluate it on our collected Human Action Understanding (HAU) dataset. Experimental results show that our approach can accurately localize, categorize and describe multiple actions in realistic videos.},

abstract = {An original approach for ambulatory measurement and analysis of lower limb 3D gait posture was presented, and a wearable sensor system was developed according to the approach. To explicate the lower limb posture, thigh orientation angles were calculated based on a virtual sensor at the hip joint and double analog inertial sensors (MAG3) on the thigh; Knee joint angle in sagittal plane was calculated with combination of angular accelerations and angular velocities measured by two MAG3 on the thigh and shank on the basis of the virtual-sensor based algorithm. The developed wearable sensor system was evaluated on the lower limb. Without integration of angular acceleration or angular velocity for the thigh orientation angles and the knee joint angle, the calculated result was not distorted by offset and drift. Using virtual sensors at the hip joint and the knee joint were more simple, practical and effective than fixing physical sensors at these joints. Compared with the result from the reference system, the measured result with the developed wearable sensor system was feasible to do gait analysis for the patients in the daily life, and the method can also be used in other conditions such as measuring rigid segment posture with less sensors and high degree of accuracy. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

Most previous techniques assumed that the state space is known a priori or employed simple state representations that usually suffer from perceptual aliasing. Different from previous research, we propose a novel approach named Sequence-based Multimodal Apprenticeship Learning (SMAL), which is capable to simultaneously fusing temporal information and multimodal data, and to integrate robot perception with decision making. To evaluate the SMAL approach, experiments are performed using both simulations and real-world robots in the challenging search and rescue scenarios. The empirical study has validated that our SMAL approach can effectively learn plans for robots to make decisions using sequence of multimodal observations. Experimental results have also showed that SMAL outperforms the baseline methods using individual images.},

abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid tele-manipulation system, comprising of a sensorized 3D-printed soft robotic gripper and a soft fabric-based haptic glove, that aim at improving grasping manipulation and providing sensing feedback to the operators. The flexible 3D-printed soft robotic gripper broadens what a robotic gripper can do, especially for grasping tasks where delicate objects such as glassware are involved. It consists of four pneumatic finger actuators, casings with through hole for housing the actuators, and adjustable base. The grasping length and width can be configured easily to suit a variety of objects. The soft haptic glove is equipped with flex sensors and soft pneumatic haptic actuator, which enables the users to control the grasping, to determine whether the grasp is successful and to identify the grasped object shape. The fabric-based soft pneumatic haptic actuator can simulate haptic perception by producing force feedback to the users. Both the soft pneumatic finger actuator and haptic actuator involve simple fabrication technique, namely 3D-printed approach and fabric-based approach respectively, which reduce fabrication complexity as compared to the steps involved in traditional silicone-based approach. The sensorized soft robotic gripper is capable of picking up and holding a wide variety of objects in this study, ranging from lightweight delicate object weighing less than 50 g to objects weighing 1100 g. The soft haptic actuator can produce forces of up to 2.1 N, which is more than the minimum force of 1.5 N needed to stimulate haptic perception. The subjects are able to differentiate the two objects with significant shape differences in the pilot test. Compared to the existing soft grippers, this is the first soft sensorized 3D-printed gripper, coupled with a soft fabric-based haptic glove, that has the potential to improve the robotic grasping manipulation by introducing haptic feedback to the users.},

Soft robotic actuators inspired by elephant trunks, octopus limbs and muscular hydrostats are suggestive of ways to overcome this fundamental difficulty. In particular, the large intrinsic compliance of soft manipulators such as ‘pneu-nets'—pneumatically actuated elastomeric structures—makes them ideal for applications that require interactions with an uncertain mechanical and geometrical environment. Using a simple theoretical model, we show how the geometric and material nonlinearities inherent in the passive mechanical response of such devices can be used to grasp soft objects using force control, and stiff objects using position control, without any need for active sensing or feedback control. Our study is suggestive of a general principle for designing actuators with autonomous intrinsic impedance control.},

To develop such a technology, an actuator safe and friendly for human is required. It should be small, lightweight and has to provide a proper softness. We call such an actuator soft actuator . A pneumatic rubber artificial muscle is one of typical soft actuators, which is useful for the human assist technology. We have developed some types of pneumatic rubber artificial muscles and applied them to human friendly soft mechanisms and wearable power assist devices. Since th ese mechanism and devices directly act on the human body, the human friendliness is essentially important.

abstract = {The rehabilitation community is at the threshold of a new age in which orthotic and prosthetic devices will no longer be separate, lifeless mechanisms, but intimate extensions of the human body-structurally, neurologically, and dynamically. In this paper we discuss scientific and technological advances that promise to accelerate the merging of body and machine, including the development of actuator the human body—structurally, technologies that behave like muscle and control methodologies that exploit principles of biological movement. We present a state-of-the-art device for leg rehabilitation: a powered ankle-foot orthosis for stroke, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis patients. The device employs a force- controllable actuator and a biomimetic control scheme that automatically modulates ankle impedance and motive torque to satisfy patient-specific gait requirements. Although the device has some clinical benefits, problems still remain. The force-controllable actuator comprises an electric motor and a mechanical transmission, resulting in a heavy, bulky, and noisy mechanism. As a resolution of this difficulty, we argue that electroactive polymer-based artificial muscle technologies may offer considerable advantages to the physically challenged, allowing for joint impedance and motive force controllability, noise-free operation, and anthropomorphic device morphologies.},

abstract = {Wearable robots based on soft materials will augment mobility and performance of the host without restricting natural kinematics. Such wearable robots will need soft sensors to monitor the movement of the wearer and robot outside the lab. Until now wearable soft sensors have not demonstrated significant mechanical robustness nor been systematically characterized for human motion studies of walking and running. Here, we present the design and systematic characterization of a soft sensing suit for monitoring hip, knee, and ankle sagittal plane joint angles. We used hyper-elastic strain sensors based on microchannels of liquid metal embedded within elastomer, but refined their design with the use of discretized stiffness gradients to improve mechanical durability. We found that these robust sensors could stretch up to 396{\%} of their original lengths, would restrict the wearer by less than 0.17{\%} of any given joint's torque, had gauge factor sensitivities of greater than 2.2, and exhibited less than 2{\%} change in electromechanical specifications through 1500 cycles of loading–unloading. We also evaluated the accuracy and variability of the soft sensing suit by comparing it with joint angle data obtained through optical motion capture. The sensing suit had root mean square (RMS) errors of less than 5° for a walking speed of 0.89 m/s and reached a maximum RMS error of 15° for a running speed of 2.7 m/s. Despite the deviation of absolute measure, the relative repeatability of the sensing suit's joint angle measurements were statistically equivalent to that of optical motion capture at all speeds. We anticipate that wearable soft sensing will also have applications beyond wearable robotics, such as in medical diagnostics and in human–computer interaction.},

To enable persistent sensing and estimation in such a setting, it is beneficial to have a time-varying underlying environmental model. Here we present a planning and learning method that enables an autonomous marine vehicle to perform persistent ocean monitoring tasks by learning and refining an environmental model. To alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we propose a framework that iterates between a planning component aimed at collecting the most information-rich data, and a sparse Gaussian Process learning component where the environmental model and hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. Our simulations with ground-truth ocean data shows that the proposed method is both accurate and efficient.},

abstract = {Head drop is a symptom commonly seen in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These patients usually experience neck pain and have difficulty in swallowing and breathing. Static neck braces are used in current treatment. These braces, however, immobilize the head in a single configuration, which causes muscle atrophy. This letter presents the design of a dynamic neck brace for the first time in the literature, which can both measure and potentially assist in the head motion of the human user. This letter introduces the brace design method and validates its capability to perform measurements. The brace is designed based on kinematics data collected from a healthy individual via a motion capture system. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the wearability of the brace and the accuracy of measurements with the brace. This study recruited ten participants who performed a series of head motions. The results of this human study indicate that the brace is wearable by individuals who vary in size, the brace allows nearly 70{\%} of the overall range of head rotations, and the sensors on the brace give accurate motion of the head with an error of under 5{\&}{\#}x00B0; when compared to a motion capture system. We believe that this neck brace can be a valid and accurate measurement tool for human head motion. This brace will be a big improvement in the available technologies to measure head motion as these are currently done in the clinic using hand-held protractors in two orthogonal planes.},

abstract = {Soft robots actuated by infl ation of a pneumatic network (a “pneu-net”) of small channels in elastomeric materials are appealing for producing sophisticated motions with simple controls. Although current designs of pneu-nets achieve motion with large amplitudes, they do so relatively slowly (over seconds). This paper describes a new design for pneu-nets that reduces the amount of gas needed for infl ation of the pneu-net, and thus increases its speed of actuation. A simple actuator can bend from a linear to a quasicircular shape in 50 ms when pressurized at $\Delta$ P = 345 kPa. At high rates of pressurization, the path along which the actuator bends depends on this rate. When infl ated fully, the chambers of this new design experience only one-tenth the change in volume of that required for the previous design. This small change in volume requires comparably low levels of strain in the material at maximum amplitudes of actuation, and commensurately low rates of fatigue and failure. This actuator can operate over a million cycles without signifi cant degradation of performance. This design for soft robotic actuators combines high rates of actuation with high reliability of the actuator, and opens new areas of application for them.},

abstract = {Garment-integrated sensors equip clothes with a smart sensing capability, while preserving the comfort of the user. However, this benefit can be to the detriment of sensing accuracy due to the unpredictability of garment movement (which affects sensor positioning) and textile folds (which can affect sensor orientation). However, sensors integrated directly into garments or fabric structures can also be used to detect the movement of the garment during wearing. Specifically, a textile bend sensor could be used to sense folds in the garment. We tested a garment-integrated stitched sensor for five types of folds, stitched on five different weights of un-stretchable denim fabric and analyzed the effects of fold complexity and fabric stiffness, under un-insulated and insulated conditions. Results show that insulation improves the linearity and repeatability of the sensor response, particularly for higher fold complexity. Stiffer fabrics show greater sensitivity, but less linearity. Sensor response amplitude is larger for more complex fold geometries. The utility of a linear bending response (insulated) and a binary shorting response (un-insulated) is discussed. Overall, the sensor exhibits excellent repeatability and accuracy, particularly for a fiber-based, textile-integrated sensor.},

abstract = {We propose a novel approach for training deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that allows us to tradeoff complexity and accuracy to learn lightweight models suitable for robotic platforms such as AgBot II (which performs automated weed management). Our approach consists of three stages, the first is to adapt a pre-trained model to the task at hand. This provides state-of-the-art performance but at the cost of high computational complexity resulting in a low frame rate of just 0.12 frames per second (fps). Second, we use the adapted model and employ model compression techniques to learn a lightweight DCNN that is less accurate but has two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Third, K lightweight models are combined as a mixture model to further enhance the performance of the lightweight models. Applied to the challenging task of weed segmentation, we improve accuracy from 85.9{\%}, using a traditional approach, to 93.9{\%} by adapting a complicated pre-trained DCNN with 25M parameters (Inception-v3). The downside to this adapted model, Adapted-IV3, is that it can only process 0.12fps. To make this approach fast while still retaining accuracy, we learn lightweight DCNNs which when combined can achieve accuracy greater than 90{\%} while using considerably fewer parameters capable of processing between 1.07 and 1.83 frames per second, up to an order of magnitude faster and up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent advances in Deep Learning for robot control, this paper considers two learning algorithms in terms of how they acquire demonstrations. "Human-Centric" (HC) sampling is the standard supervised learning algorithm, where a human supervisor demonstrates the task by teleoperating the robot to provide trajectories consisting of state-control pairs. "Robot-Centric" (RC) sampling is an increasingly popular alternative used in algorithms such as DAgger, where a human supervisor observes the robot executing a learned policy and provides corrective control labels for each state visited. RC sampling can be challenging for human supervisors and prone to mislabeling. RC sampling can also induce error in policy performance because it repeatedly visits areas of the state space that are harder to learn. Although policies learned with RC sampling can be superior to HC sampling for standard learning models such as linear SVMs, policies learned with HC sampling may be comparable with highly-expressive learning models such as deep learning and hyper-parametric decision trees, which have little model error. We compare HC and RC using a grid world and a physical robot singulation task, where in the latter the input is a binary image of a connected set of objects on a planar worksurface and the policy generates a motion of the gripper to separate one object from the rest. We observe in simulation that for linear SVMs, policies learned with RC outperformed those learned with HC but that with deep models this advantage disappears. We also find that with RC, the corrective control labels provided by humans can be highly inconsistent. We prove there exists a class of examples where in the limit, HC is guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy while RC may fail to converge.},

abstract = {Quadrotors are well suited for executing fast maneu- vers with high accelerations but they are still unable to follow a fast trajectory with centimeter accuracy without iteratively learning it beforehand. In this paper, we present a novel body-rate controller and an iterative thrust-mixing scheme, which improve the trajectory-tracking performance without requiring learning and reduce the yaw control error of a quadrotor, respectively. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first algorithm to cope with motor saturations smartly by prioritizing control inputs which are relevant for stabilization and trajectory tracking. The presented body-rate controller uses LQR-control methods to consider both the body rate and the single motor dynamics, which reduces the overall trajectory-tracking error while still rejecting external disturbances well. Our iterative thrust-mixing scheme computes the four rotor thrusts given the inputs from a position-control pipeline. Through the iterative computation, we are able to consider a varying ratio of thrust and drag torque of a single propeller over its input range, which allows applying the desired yaw torque more precisely and hence reduces the yaw-control error. Our prioritizing motor-saturation scheme improves stability and robustness of a quadrotor's flight and may prevent unstable behavior in case of motor saturations. We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking, yaw-control, and robustness in case of motor saturations in real-world exper- iments with a quadrotor.},

abstract = {Intelligent robots and machines are becoming pervasive in human populated environments. A desirable capability of these agents is to respond to goal-oriented commands by autonomously constructing task plans. However, such autonomy can add significant cognitive load and potentially introduce safety risks to humans when agents behave unexpectedly. Hence, for such agents to be helpful, one important requirement is for them to synthesize plans that can be easily understood by humans. While there exists previous work that studied socially acceptable robots that interact with humans in "natural ways", and work that investigated legible motion planning, there lacks a general solution for high level task planning. To address this issue, we introduce the notions of plan {\{}$\backslash$it explicability{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$it predictability{\}}. To compute these measures, first, we postulate that humans understand agent plans by associating abstract tasks with agent actions, which can be considered as a labeling process. We learn the labeling scheme of humans for agent plans from training examples using conditional random fields (CRFs). Then, we use the learned model to label a new plan to compute its explicability and predictability. These measures can be used by agents to proactively choose or directly synthesize plans that are more explicable and predictable to humans. We provide evaluations on a synthetic domain and with human subjects using physical robots to show the effectiveness of our approach},

Basic convergence properties of this algorithm are proven. These proofs do not require the restrictive assumption that the Jacobians of the motion and observation models need to be evaluated at the ground truth. It is also shown that the output of RI-EKF is invariant under any stochastic rigid body transformation in contrast to {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}SO{\}}(3){\$} based EKF SLAM algorithm ({\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}SO{\}}(3){\$}-EKF) that is only invariant under deterministic rigid body transformation. Implications of these invariance properties on the consistency of the estimator are also discussed.

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

We describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of a novel soft multi-axis force sensor made of highly deformable materials. The sensor is capable of measuring normal and in-plane shear forces. This soft sensor is composed of an elastomer (modulus: 69 kPa) with embedded microchannels filled with a conductive liquid. Depending on the magnitude and the direction of an applied force, all or part of the microchannels will be compressed, changing their electrical resistance. The two designs presented in this paper differ in their flexibility and channel configurations. The channel dimensions are approximately 200 × 200 $\mu$m and 300 × 700 $\mu$m for the two prototypes, respectively. The overall size of each sensor is 50 × 60 × 7 mm. The first prototype demonstrated force sensitivities along the two principal in-plane axes of 37.0 and −28.6 mV/N. The second prototype demonstrated the capability to detecting and differentiating normal and in-plane forces.

The developed finger-rehabilitation robot is composed of a thumb-rehabilitation robot instrument and four finger-rehabilitation robot instruments. The finger-rehabilitation robot could exercise fingers of patient for their rehabilitation, and it is a flexibility rehabilitation exercise. The finger-rehabilitation robot instruments move according to the trace which spread out the patient's fingers and then turn them inward for the fingers' flexibility, while at the same time performing the force control with the reference forces for fingers' safety. A control characteristic test of the developed finger-rehabilitation robot was carried out, and the result confirmed that the robot could be used for the flexibility rehabilitation exercise for the fingers of normal person and patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Rolling locomotion using an external force such as gravity has evolved many times. However, some caterpillars can curl into a wheel and generate their own rolling momentum as part of an escape repertoire. This change in body conformation occurs well within 100 ms and generates a linear velocity over 0.2 m s(-1), making it one of the fastest self-propelled wheeling behaviors in nature. Inspired by this behavior, we construct a soft-bodied robot to explore the dynamics and control issues of ballistic rolling. This robot, called GoQBot, closely mimics caterpillar rolling. Analyzing the whole body kinematics and 2D ground reaction forces at the robot ground anchor reveals about 1G of acceleration and more than 200 rpm of angular velocity. As a novel rolling robot, GoQBot demonstrates how morphing can produce new modes of locomotion. Furthermore, mechanical coupling of the actuators improves body coordination without sensory feedback. Such coupling is intrinsic to soft-bodied animals because there are no joints to isolate muscle-generated movements. Finally, GoQBot provides an estimate of the mechanical power for caterpillar rolling that is comparable to that of a locust jump. How caterpillar musculature produces such power in such a short time is yet to be discovered.},

First we formulate this problem as an optimal control problem for switched systems. Then we propose a multi--level optimization approach to find the optimal switching times and the optimal continuous control inputs. Through this scheme, the decomposed optimization can potentially be done more efficiently than the combined approach. Finally, we present a continuous-time constrained LQR algorithm which simultaneously optimizes the feedforward and feedback controller with {\$}O(n){\$} time-complexity. In order to validate our approach, we show the performance of our framework on a quadrupedal robot. We choose the Center of Mass dynamics and the full kinematic formulation as the switched system model where the switching times as well as the contact forces and the joint velocities are optimized for different locomotion tasks such as gap crossing, walking and trotting.},

abstract = {— Tracking for planar objects is an important issue to vision-based robotic applications. In direct visual tracking (DVT) methods, the similarity between two images is often measured through the sum of squared differences (SSD) espe-cially with the efficient second-order minimization (ESM) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, SSD-based ESM is not robust to illumination changes since it is usually built upon the brightness constancy assumption. Contrast to image brightness, gradient orientations (GO) are invariant to both linear and non-linear illumination changes as verified in practice. Based on GO, we propose an illumination insensitive ESM method for planar object tracking in this paper. In order to introduce GO into the ESM, we generalized the original ESM formulas for multi-dimensional features. In addition, a denoising method based on the Perona-Malik function and a mask image were suggested to improve GO's robustness against image noise and low texture. Our experimental results on dataset for planar objects with illumination changes and a benchmark dataset confirm the proposed method is robust to illumination variations and capable to deal with the general tracking challenges.},

abstract = {In contact-based manipulations, the effects of the robot�fs actions change as contacts are made or broken. For example, if a robot applies an increasing upward force to an object, then the force will eventually overcome the object�fs weight and break the object-table contact. The robot can subsequently raise or lower the height of the object. The transition from resting on the table to not being in contact with the table is an example of a mode switch. The conditions for this mode switch depend on the mass of the object being manipulated. By modeling the mode switch, the robot can estimate the mass of the object based on the conditions when the mode switch occurs. The robot can also use the model to predict when the object will break contact given its mass. We evaluated four different autoregressive hidden Markov models for representing manipulations with mass-dependent mode switches. The models were successfully evaluated on pushing and lifting tasks. The evaluations show that the predicted object trajectories and estimated object masses are more accurate when using models that interpolate between different masses, and that consider the observed state for estimating the mode switches.},

Robotic devices offer a unique training environment that may enhance outcomes beyond what is possible with conventional means. Robots apply forces to the hand, allowing completion of movements while preventing inappropriate movement patterns. Evidence from the literature is emerging that certain characteristics of the human-robot interaction are preferable. In light of this evidence, the robotic hand devices that have undergone clinical testing are reviewed, highlighting the authors' work in this area. Finally, suggestions for future work are offered. The ability to deliver therapy doses far higher than what has been previously tested is a potentially key advantage of robotic devices that needs further exploration. In particular, more efforts are needed to develop highly motivating home-based devices, which can increase access to high doses of assisted movement therapy.},

abstract = {DASH+Wings is a small hexapedal winged robot that uses flapping wings to increase its locomotion capabilities. To examine the effects of flapping wings, multiple experimental controls for the same locomotor platform are provided by wing removal, by the use of inertially similar lateral spars, and by passive rather than actively flapping wings. We used accelerometers and high-speed cameras to measure the performance of this hybrid robot in both horizontal running and while ascending inclines. To examine consequences of wing flapping for aerial performance, we measured lift and drag forces on the robot at constant airspeeds and body orientations in a wind tunnel; we also determined equilibrium glide performance in free flight. The addition of flapping wings increased the maximum horizontal running speed from 0.68 to 1.29 m s⁻¹, and also increased the maximum incline angle of ascent from 5.6° to 16.9°. Free flight measurements show a decrease of 10.3° in equilibrium glide slope between the flapping and gliding robot. In air, flapping improved the mean lift:drag ratio of the robot compared to gliding at all measured body orientations and airspeeds. Low-amplitude wing flapping thus provides advantages in both cursorial and aerial locomotion. We note that current support for the diverse theories of avian flight origins derive from limited fossil evidence, the adult behavior of extant flying birds, and developmental stages of already volant taxa. By contrast, addition of wings to a cursorial robot allows direct evaluation of the consequences of wing flapping for locomotor performance in both running and flying.},

However, does human performance improve with three hands compared to two hands? To evaluate this possibility, we carried out a behavioural study on the performance of naive adults catching objects with three virtual hands controlled by their two hands and right foot. The subjects could successfully control the virtual hands in a few trials. With this control strategy, the workspace of the hands was inversely correlated with the task velocity. The comparison of performance between the three and two hands control revealed no significant difference of success in catching falling objects and in average effort during the tasks. Subjects preferred the three handed control strategy, found it easier, with less physical and mental burden. Although the coordination of the foot with the natural hands increased trial after trial, about two minutes of practice was not sufficient to develop a sense of ownership towards the third arm.},

abstract = {In this paper, we will argue that if we want to understand the function of the brain (or the control in the case of robots), we must understand how the brain is embedded into the physical system, and how the organism interacts with the real world. While embodiment has often been used in its trivial meaning, i.e. 'intelligence requires a body', the concept has deeper and more important implications, concerned with the relation between physical and information (neural, control) processes. A number of case studies are presented to illustrate the concept. These involve animals and robots and are concentrated around locomotion, grasping, and visual perception. A theoretical scheme that can be used to embed the diverse case studies will be presented. Finally, we will establish a link between the low-level sensory-motor processes and cognition. We will present an embodied view on categorization, and propose the concepts of 'body schema' and 'forward models' as a natural extension of the embodied approach toward first representations.},

abstract = {We present an approach for reconstructing vehicles from a single (RGB) image, in the context of autonomous driving. Though the problem appears to be ill-posed, we demonstrate that prior knowledge about how 3D shapes of vehicles project to an image can be used to reason about the reverse process, i.e., how shapes (back-)project from 2D to 3D. We encode this knowledge in $\backslash$emph{\{}shape priors{\}}, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then formulate a shape-aware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle $\backslash$emph{\{}keypoints{\}} in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving benchmarks, and present superior results to existing monocular, as well as stereo approaches.},

abstract = {Mechanical testing and modelling of a material for biomedical applications have to be based on conditions representative of the application of interest. In this work, an ether-based polyurethane elastomer is used to build mock arteries. The aim is to study the behaviour of arteries under pulsatile loading conditions and how that behaviour changes with the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Polyurethane elastomers are widely used as biomaterials, e.g.??in tube form for bypasses and catheters. However, their mechanical behaviour has not been extensively characterised. This work establishes the variations in the behaviour of polyurethane elastomer with temperature, humidity and strain rate and also reports planar and equibiaxial tension, relaxation, creep and cyclic test results, providing a comprehensive characterisation of the material. Test results are used to determine the properties of the polyurethane elastomer and in the selection of a representative material model for future simulations of arterial behaviour and the development of atherosclerosis. The results show that the behaviour of the elastomer is significantly dependent on both humidity and temperature, with Young's modulus of 7.4??MPa, 5.3??MPa and 4.7??MPa under dry-room temperature, wet-room temperature and wet at 37??{\{}ring operator{\}}C conditions, respectively. The elastomer also exhibits rate-dependent viscoelastic behaviour. Yeoh's hyperelastic material model provided the best fit to the entire range of experimental data. The Neo-Hookean model provides a good fit at small strain but significantly diverges at large strains. Nevertheless, in applications where deformations are relatively small, i.e.??below 15{\%}, the Neo-Hookean model can be used. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The first step is to identify the most informative joints which characterize the motion. The second step enriches the descriptor considering minimum and maximum joint velocities and the correlations between the most informative joints. In order to compute the distances between action descriptors, we propose a novel correlation-based similarity measure. The performance of CODE is tested on two public datasets, namely HDM05 and Berkeley MHAD, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches, showing recognition results.},

They, as human muscles, work in agonistic-antagonistic way, giving a traction force only when supplied by compressed air. The state of the art of soft pneumatic actuators is here analyzed: different models of pneumatic muscles are considered and evolution lines are presented. Then, the use of Pneumatic Muscles (PAM) in rehabilitation apparatus is described and the general characteristics required in different applications are considered, analyzing the use of proper soft actuators with various technical properties. Therefore, research activity carried out in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in the field of soft and textile actuators is presented here. In particular, pneumatic textile muscles useful for active suits design are described. These components are made of a tubular structure, with an inner layer of latex coated with a deformable outer fabric sewn along the edge. In order to increase pneumatic muscles forces and contractions Braided Pneumatic Muscles are studied. In this paper, new prototypes are presented, based on a fabric construction and various kinds of geometry. Pressure-force-deformation tests results are carried out and analyzed. These actuators are useful for rehabilitation applications. In order to reproduce the whole upper limb movements, new kind of soft actuators are studied, based on the same principle of planar membranes deformation. As an example, the bellows muscle model and worm muscle model are developed and described. In both cases, wide deformations are expected. Another issue for soft actuators is the pressure therapy. Some textile sleeve prototypes developed for massage therapy on patients suffering of lymph edema are analyzed. Different types of fabric and assembly techniques have been tested. In general, these Pressure Soft Actuators are useful for upper/lower limbs treatments, according to medical re},

abstract = {We propose a vision-based method that localizes a ground vehicle using publicly available satellite imagery as the only prior knowledge of the environment. Our approach takes as input a sequence of ground-level images acquired by the vehicle as it navigates, and outputs an estimate of the vehicle's pose relative to a georeferenced satellite image. We overcome the significant viewpoint and appearance variations between the images through a neural multi-view model that learns location-discriminative embeddings in which ground-level images are matched with their corresponding satellite view of the scene. We use this learned function as an observation model in a filtering framework to maintain a distribution over the vehicle's pose. We evaluate our method on different benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability localize ground-level images in environments novel relative to training, despite the challenges of significant viewpoint and appearance variations.},

abstract = {Long-term results (5-20 years) recorded in 304 patients operated on stereotactically for psychopathologic disorders are presented. The largest group of 260 surgically treated subjects represented aggressive patients. This group consisted of 150 patients with mental retardation, 70 with epilepsy, 20 with schizophrenia, and 20 patients with sexual deviations. Amygdalectomy for patients with normal intellect and posterior hypothalamotomy for those with reduced intellect proved to be the most effective procedure. Symmetrical operations were also effective. In some cases a combination of two target was necessary. In epileptics with aggressivity the combination of amygdalectomy and hippocampectomy yielded the best results. In aggressivity with sexual deviations anterior hypothalamotomy was the most effective operation. Favorable results in aggressivity therapy were recorded in 60{\%} of patients. In patients with criminal sexual deviations, in drug addicts, and in alcoholics, anterior hypothalamotomy was found to be most effective, with favorable results in 50{\%} of patients. In patients with depression, thalamotomy or stimulation of the limbic regions of the thalamus decreased the depression, with favorable results recorded in 66{\%} of patients. The results of the surgically treated patients show that target-oriented stereotactic operations remove psychopathologic symptoms, improve the effectiveness of psychoactive drugs and the social adaptability of patients.

abstract = {Although autonomous robotic systems perform remarkably in structured environments (e.g., factories), integrated human--robotic systems are superior to any autonomous robotic systems in unstructured environments that demand significant adaptation. The technology associated with exoskeleton systems and human power augmentation can be divided into lower-extremity exoskeletons and upper-extremity exoskeletons. The reason for this was twofold; firstly, one could envision a great many applications for either a stand-alone lower- or upper-extremity exoskeleton in the immediate future. Secondly, and more importantly for the division, is that these exoskeletons are in their early stages, and further research still needs to be conducted to ensure that the upper-extremity exoskeleton and lower-extremity exoskeleton can function well independently before one can venture an attempt to integrate them. This chapter first gives a description of the upper-extremity exoskeleton efforts and then will proceed with the more detailed description of the lower-extremity exoskeleton. },

abstract = {We introduce a curvature sensor composed of a thin, transparent elastomer film (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) embedded with a microchannel of conductive liquid (eutectic Gallium Indium, eGaIn) and a sensing element. Bending the sensor exerts pressure on the embedded microchannel via the sensing element. Deformation of the cross-section of the microchannel leads to a change in electrical resistance. We demonstrate the functionality of the sensor through testing on a finger joint. The film is wrapped around a finger with the sensing element positioned on top of the knuckle. Finger bending both stretches the elastomer and exerts pressure on the sensing element, leading to an enhanced change in the electrical resistance. Because the sensor is soft (elastic modulus E {\&}{\#}x223C; 1 MPa) and stretchable ({\&}{\#}x003E;350{\%}), it conforms to the host bending without interfering with the natural mechanics of motion. This sensor represents the first use of liquid-embedded elastomer electronics to monitor human or robotic motion.},

In our previous research (2001), a prototype of a two degree of freedom exoskeletal robots for shoulder joint motion assist have been developed. In this paper, we propose an effective fuzzy-neuro controller, a moving mechanism of the center of rotation (CR) of the shoulder joint of the exoskeletal robot, and an intelligent interface in order to realize a practical and effective exoskeletal robot for shoulder joint motion assist. The fuzzy-neuro controller enables the robot to assist a person's shoulder motion. The moving mechanism of the CR of the robot shoulder joint is used to fit the CR of the robot shoulder joint to that of the physiological human shoulder joint during the shoulder motion. The intelligent interface is realized by applying a neural network and used to cancel out the effect the human subject's arm posture change. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by experiment.},

abstract = {The comfort of wearable sensors is often limited by the materials and construction methods of sensors. Here, we present a textile-based stretch sensor that is formed using a common industrial sewing machine, in an overlock formation. Swapping a single thread in the stitch for a conductive thread renders the stitch responsive to stretch through opening and closing short circuits in the looped structure of the exposed conductor. However, the sensor response is influenced by the mechanical properties of the textile to which it is stitched. We explore the influence of fiber content (with an emphasis on elastomeric fiber content) on the baseline drift, response range, and hysteresis of the stitched sensor. Results show that the sensor provides a reliable and repeatable response, with a linear region that spans from the relaxed position to between 18 and 29{\%} elongation. Average drift of about 0.5 Ohm and hysteresis of about 1 Ohm were measured. Effects of fiber content were observed, but do not show clear relationships to percentage of elastomer content.},

abstract = {The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms composed of a pe-culiar muscular structure, named a muscular hydrostat. The octopus arms provide it with both locomotion and grasping capabilities, thanks to the fact that their stiffness can change over a wide range and can be controlled through combined contractions of the muscles. The muscular hydrostat can better be seen as a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tis-sues are such that the interaction with the environment (i.e., water) is exploited to simplify control. Thanks to this effective mechanism of embodied intelligence, the octopus can control a very high number of degrees of freedom, with relatively limited computing resources. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a good model for embodied intelligence and for soft robotics. The prototype of a robot arm has been built based on an artificial muscular hydrostat inspired to the muscular hydrostat of the Octopus vulgaris. The prototype presents the morphology of the biological model and the broad arrangement of longitudinal and transverse muscles. Actuation is obtained with cables (longitudinally) and with shape memory alloy springs (transversally). The robot arm combines contractions and it can show the basic movements of the octopus arm, like elongation, shortening and bending, in water.},

A framework is proposed instead to characterize human hand prehensile strength in generic form by describing external force and moment wrench capability, where a wrench is a vector describing the forces and moments applied at a point. It is further suggested that if tools and activities are characterized by the internal forces and external forces and moments required, a better understanding of the human prehension in occupational settings and during activities of daily living can be obtained. An example of using a pistol grip drill is used to show the utility of the approach.},

abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot's Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

This process is reversible and can be strategically used to build fluidic components for innovative soft robots capable of soft locomotion. In this work, we show the potential applications of ER fluids to build valves that simplify design of fluidic based soft robots. We propose the design and development of a composite ER valve, aimed at controlling the flexibility of soft robots bodies by controlling the ER fluid flow. We present how an ad hoc number of such soft components can be embodied in a simple crawling soft robot (Wormbot); in a locomotion mechanism capable of forward motion through rotation; and, in a tendon driven continuum arm. All these embodiments show how simplification of the hydraulic circuits relies on the simple structure of ER valves. Finally, we address preliminary experiments to characterize the behavior of Wormbot in terms of actuation forces.},

Based on Gibbs sampling, our weakly supervised grammar learning can automatically construct a hierarchical representation of an interaction with long-term joint sub-tasks of both agents and short term atomic actions of individual agents. Based on a new RGB-D video dataset with rich instances of human interactions, our experiments of Baxter simulation, human evaluation, and real Baxter test demonstrate that the model learned from limited training data successfully generates human-like behaviors in unseen scenarios and outperforms both baselines.},

In many problems like self calibration or model parameter identification some states are only observable under a specific motion. These motions are often hard to find, especially for inexperienced users. Therefore, we consider system model identification in an active setting, where the vehicle autonomously decides what actions to take in order to quickly identify the model. Our algorithm approximates the belief dynamics of the system around a candidate trajectory using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). It uses sampling-based motion planning to explore the space of possible beliefs and find a maximally informative trajectory within a user-defined budget. We validate our method in simulation and on a real system showing the feasibility and repeatability of the proposed approach. Our planner creates trajectories which reduce model parameter convergence time and uncertainty by a factor of four.},

By casting the problem into a probabilistic framework, we not only remove the need for commonly employed heuristic parameters but also provide a powerful score to classify matching and non-matching places. We present methods for both a 2D-2D pose-graph vertex matching and a 2D-3D landmark matching based on the above scoring. The approach maintains accuracy while being efficient enough for online application through the use of compact (low dimensional) descriptors and fast nearest neighbor retrieval techniques. The proposed methods are evaluated on several challenging datasets in varied environments, showing state-of-the-art results with high precision and high recall.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to provide consistent, real-time 3D localization capabilities to mobile devices navigating within previously mapped areas. To this end, we introduce the Cholesky-Schmidt-Kalman filter (C-SKF), which explicitly considers the uncertainty of the prior map, by employing the sparse Cholesky factor of the map's Hessian, instead of its dense covariance--as is the case for the Schmidt-Kalman filter (SKF). By doing so, the C-SKF has memory requirements typically linear in the size of the map, as opposed to quadratic for storing the map's covariance. Moreover, and in order to bound the processing needs of the C-SKF (between linear and quadratic in the size of the map), we introduce a relaxation of the C-SKF algorithm, the sC-SKF, which operates on the Cholesky factors of independent sub-maps resulting from dividing the trajectory and observations used for constructing the map into overlapping segments. Lastly, we assess the processing and memory requirements of the proposed C-SKF and sC-SKF algorithms, and compare their positioning accuracy against other approximate map-based localization approaches that employ measurement-noise-covariance inflation to compensate for the map's uncertainty.},

abstract = {Soft dielectric materials typically exhibit poor heat transfer properties due to the dynamics of phonon transport, which constrain thermal conductivity (k) to decrease monotonically with decreasing elastic modulus (E). This thermal−mechanical trade-off is limiting for wearable computing, soft robotics, and other emerging applications that require materials with both high thermal conductivity and low mechanical stiffness. Here, we overcome this constraint with an electrically insulating composite that exhibits an unprecedented combination of metal-like thermal conductivity, an elastic compliance similar to soft biological tissue (Young's modulus {\textless} 100 kPa), and the capability to undergo extreme deformations ({\textgreater}600{\%} strain). By incorporating liquid metal (LM) microdroplets into a soft elastomer, we achieve a ∼25× increase in thermal conductivity (4.7 ± 0.2 W⋅m−1⋅K−1) over the base polymer (0.20 ± 0.01 W⋅m−1{\textperiodcentered}K−1) under stress-free conditions and a ∼50× increase (9.8 ± 0.8 W⋅m−1{\textperiodcentered}K−1) when strained. This exceptional combination of thermal and mechanical properties is enabled by a unique thermal−mechanical coupling that exploits the deformability of the LM inclusions to create thermally conductive pathways in situ. Moreover, these materials offer possibilities for passive heat exchange in stretchable electronics and bioinspired robotics, which we demonstrate through the rapid heat dissipation of an elastomer-mounted extreme high-power LED lamp and a swimming soft robot.},

abstract = {— Direct visual odometry and Simultaneous Lo-calization and Mapping (SLAM) methods determine camera poses by means of direct image alignment. This optimizes a photometric cost term based on the Lucas-Kanade method. Many recent works use the brightness constancy assumption in the alignment cost formulation and therefore cannot cope with significant illumination changes. Such changes are especially likely to occur for loop closures in SLAM. Alternatives exist which attempt to match images more robustly. In our paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of real-time capable methods. We determine their accuracy and robustness in the context of odometry and of loop closures, both on real images as well as synthetic datasets with simulated lighting changes. We find that for real images, a Census-based method outperforms the others. We make our new datasets available online 3 .},

abstract = {To perform essential daily activities the movement of shoulder, elbow, and wrist play a vital role and therefore proper functioning of upper-limb is very much essential. We therefore have been developing an exoskeleton robot (ExoRob) to rehabilitate and to ease upper limb motion. Toward to make a complete (i.e., 7DOF) upper-arm motion assisted robotic exoskeleton this paper focused on the development of a 2DOF exoskeleton robot to rehabilitate the elbow and forearm movements. The proposed 2DOF ExoRob is supposed to be worn on the lateral side of forearm and provide naturalistic range movements of elbow (flexion/extension) and forearm (pronation/supination) motions. This paper also focuses on the modeling and control of the proposed ExoRob. A kinematic model of the ExoRob has been developed based on modified Denavit-Hartenberg notations. Nonlinear sliding mode control technique is employed in dynamic simulation of the proposed ExoRob, where trajectory tracking that corresponds to typical rehab (passive) exercises has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed model and controller. Simulated results show that the controller is able to maneuver the ExoRob efficiently to track the desired trajectories, which in this case consisted in passive arm movements. These movements are widely used in rehab therapy and could be performed efficiently with the developed ExoRob and the controller.},

Here we present an elastomeric microtube-based pneumatic actuator that can be extended into a microrobotic tentacle. We establish a new, direct peeling-based technique for building long and thin, highly deformable microtubes and a semi-analytical model for their shape-engineering. Using them in combination, we amplify the microtube's pneumatically-driven bending into multi-turn inward spiraling. The resulting micro-tentacle exhibit spiraling with the final radius as small as {\~{}}185 µ m and grabbing force of {\~{}}0.78 mN, rendering itself ideal for non-damaging manipulation of soft, fragile micro-objects. This spiraling tentacle-based grabbing modality, the direct peeling-enabled elastomeric microtube fabrication technique, and the concept of microtube shape-engineering are all unprecedented and will enrich the field of soft-robotics.},

@article{Dinh2017,
abstract = {In recent years soft wearable exoskeletons, com- monly referred to as exosuits, have been widely exploited in human assistance. Hence a shared approach for a systematic and exhaustive control architecture is extremely important. Most of the exosuits developed so far employ a bowden cable trans- mission to conveniently place the actuator away from the end- effector. Whilst having many advantages this actuation strategy presents some intrinsic limitations caused by the presence of nonlinearities, such as friction and backlash of the cables, which make it difficult to predict and control the dynamics between the device and the user. In the present paper, we propose a novel hierarchical control paradigm for a cable-driven upper limb exosuits that aims at evaluating and consequently deliver the appropriate assistive torque to the user's elbow joint. The proposed control method comprises three main layers: an active impedance control which estimates the user's arm motion intention and guarantees an intuitive response of the suit to the wearer's motion; a mid-level controller which compensates for the backlash in the transmission and converts the reference arm motion to the desired position of the actuator; a low-level controller which is responsible for driving the actuation stage by compensating for the non linear dynamics occurring in the bowden cable to provide the desired assistive torque at the joint. Tests on healthy subjects show that wearing the exosuit reduces by 48.3{\%} the muscular effort required to lift 1kg and that the controller is able to modulate its level of assistance to the wearer's motor ability.

abstract = {Soft robotics is a growing area of research which utilises the compliance and adaptability of soft structures to develop highly adaptive robotics for soft interactions. One area in which soft robotics has the ability to make significant impact is in the development of soft grippers and manipulators. With an increased requirement for automation, robotics systems are required to perform task in unstructured and not well defined environments; conditions which conventional rigid robotics are not best suited. This requires a paradigm shift in the methods and materials used to develop robots such that they can adapt to and work safely in human environments. One solution to this is soft robotics, which enables soft interactions with the surroundings whilst maintaining the ability to apply significant force. This review paper assess the current materials and methods, actuation methods and sensors which are used in the development of soft manipulators. The achievements and shortcomings of recent technology in these key areas are evaluated, and this paper concludes with a discussion on the potential impacts of soft manipulators on industry and society.},

abstract = {We developed a powered ankle-foot orthosis that uses artificial pneumatic muscles to produce active plantar flexor torque. The purpose of this study was to quantify the mechanical performance of the orthosis during human walking. Three subjects walked at a range of speeds wearing ankle-foot orthoses with either one or two artificial muscles working in parallel. The orthosis produced similar total peak plantar flexor torque and network across speeds independent of the number of muscles used. The orthosis generated ???57{\%} of the peak ankle plantar flexor torque during stance and performed ???70{\%} of the positive plantar flexor work done during normal walking. Artificial muscle bandwidth and force-length properties were the two primary factors limiting torque production. The lack of peak force and work differences between single and double muscle conditions can be explained by force-length properties. Subjects altered their ankle kinematics between conditions resulting in changes in artificial muscle length. In the double muscle condition greater plantar flexion yielded shorter artificial muscles lengths and decreased muscle forces. This finding emphasizes the importance of human testing in the design and development of robotic exoskeleton devices for assisting human movement. The results of this study outline the mechanical performance limitations of an ankle-foot orthosis powered by artificial pneumatic muscles. This orthosis could be valuable for gait rehabilitation and for studies investigating neuromechanical control of human walking. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We describe the design and control of a wearable robotic device powered by pneumatic artificial muscle actuators for use in ankle-foot rehabilitation. The design is inspired by the biological musculoskeletal system of the human foot and lower leg, mimicking the morphology and the functionality of the biological muscle-tendon-ligament structure. A key feature of the device is its soft structure that provides active assistance without restricting natural degrees of freedom at the ankle joint. Four pneumatic artificial muscles assist dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as inversion and eversion. The prototype is also equipped with various embedded sensors for gait pattern analysis. For the subject tested, the prototype is capable of generating an ankle range of motion of 27° (14° dorsiflexion and 13° plantarflexion). The controllability of the system is experimentally demonstrated using a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller. The controller is found using an identified LTI model of the system, resulting from the interaction of the soft orthotic device with a human leg, and model-based classical control design techniques. The suitability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated with several angle-reference following experiments.},

abstract = {Motion capture setups are used in numerous fields. Studies based on motion capture data can be found in biomechanical, sport or animal science. Clinical science studies include gait analysis as well as balance, posture and motor control. Robotic applications encompass object tracking. Today's life applications includes entertainment or augmented reality. Still, few studies investigate the positioning performance of motion capture setups. In this paper, we study the positioning performance of one player in the optoelectronic motion capture based on markers: Vicon system. Our protocol includes evaluations of static and dynamic performances. Mean error as well as positioning variabilities are studied with calibrated ground truth setups that are not based on other motion capture modalities. We introduce a new setup that enables directly estimating the absolute positioning accuracy for dynamic experiments contrary to state-of-the art works that rely on inter-marker distances. The system performs well on static experiments with a mean absolute error of 0.15 mm and a variability lower than 0.025 mm. Our dynamic experiments were carried out at speeds found in real applications. Our work suggests that the system error is less than 2 mm. We also found that marker size and Vicon sampling rate must be carefully chosen with respect to the speed encountered in the application in order to reach optimal positioning performance that can go to 0.3 mm for our dynamic study.},

abstract = {— Motion planning as trajectory optimization re-quires generating trajectories that minimize a desired objective function or performance metric. Finding a globally optimal solution is often intractable in practice: despite the existence of fast motion planning algorithms, most are prone to local min-ima, which may require re-solving the problem multiple times with different initializations. In this work we provide a novel motion planning algorithm, GPMP-GRAPH, that considers a graph-based initialization that simultaneously explores multiple homotopy classes, helping to contend with the local minima problem. Drawing on previous work to represent continuous-time trajectories as samples from a Gaussian process (GP) and formulating the motion planning problem as inference on a factor graph, we construct a graph of interconnected states such that each path through the graph is a valid trajectory and efficient inference can be performed on the collective factor graph. We perform a variety of benchmarks and show that our approach allows the evaluation of an exponential number of trajectories within a fraction of the computational time required to evaluate them one at a time, yielding a more thorough exploration of the solution space and a higher success rate.},

abstract = {— Low textured scenes are well known to be one of the main Achilles heels of geometric computer vision algorithms relying on point correspondences, and in particular for visual SLAM. Yet, there are many environments in which, despite being low textured, one can still reliably estimate line-based geometric primitives, for instance in city and indoor scenes, or in the so-called " Manhattan worlds " , where structured edges are predominant. In this paper we propose a solution to handle these situations. Specifically, we build upon ORB-SLAM, presumably the current state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy as efficiency, and extend its formulation to simultaneously handle both point and line correspondences. We propose a solution that can even work when most of the points are vanished out from the input images, and, interestingly it can be initialized from solely the detection of line correspondences in three consecutive frames. We thoroughly evaluate our approach and the new initialization strategy on the TUM RGB-D benchmark and demonstrate that the use of lines does not only improve the performance of the original ORB-SLAM solution in poorly textured frames, but also systematically improves it in sequence frames combining points and lines, without compromising the efficiency.},

This is a delicate procedure relying on small instrumentation with limited articulation to guide the laser tip and a narrow field of view to visualize all relevant vascular connections. In this paper, we report on a mechatronic design for a co-manipulated instrument that combines concentric tube actuation to a larger manipulator constrained by a remote centre of motion (RCM). A stereoscopic camera is mounted at the distal tip and used for imaging. Our mechanism provides enhanced dexterity and stability of the imaging device. We demonstrate that the imaging system can be used for computing geometry and enhancing the view at the operating site. Results using electromagnetic sensors for verification and comparison to visual odometry from the distal sensor show that our system is promising and can be developed further for multiple clinical needs in fetoscopic procedures.},

abstract = {Changing the inherent physical capabilities of robots by metamorphosis has been a long-standing goal of engineers. However, this task is challenging because of physical constraints in the robot body, each component of which has a defined functionality. To date, self-reconfiguring robots have limitations in their on-site extensibility because of the large scale of today's unit modules and the complex administration of their coordination, which relies heavily on on-board electronic components. We present an approach to extending and changing the capabilities of a robot by enabling metamorphosis using self-folding origami “exoskeletons.” We show how a cubical magnet “robot” can be remotely moved using a controllable magnetic field and hierarchically develop different morphologies by interfacing with different origami exoskeletons. Activated by heat, each exoskeleton is self-folded from a rectangular sheet, extending the capabilities of the initial robot, such as enabling the manipulation of objects or locomotion on the ground, water, or air. Activated by water, the exoskeletons can be removed and are interchangeable. Thus, the system represents an end-to-end (re)cycle. We also present several robot and exoskeleton designs, devices, and experiments with robot metamorphosis using exoskeletons.},

EPMvalves are characterized and demonstrated to be well suited for the control of elastomer fluidic actuators. The valves drive the pressurization and depressurization of fluidic channels within soft actuators. Furthermore, the forward locomotion of a soft, multi-actuator rolling robot is driven by EPM valves. The small size and energy-efficiency of EPM valves may make them valuable in soft mobile robot applications.},

abstract = {With the advancement of robotics, machine learning, and machine perception, increasingly more robots will enter human environments to assist with daily tasks. However, dynamically-changing human environments requires reactive motion plans. Reactivity can be accomplished through replanning, e.g. model-predictive control, or through a reactive feedback policy that modifies on-going behavior in response to sensory events. In this paper, we investigate how to use machine learning to add reactivity to a previously learned nominal skilled behavior. We approach this by learning a reactive modification term for movement plans represented by nonlinear differential equations. In particular, we use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to represent a skill and a neural network to learn a reactive policy from human demonstrations. We use the well explored domain of obstacle avoidance for robot manipulation as a test bed. Our approach demonstrates how a neural network can be combined with physical insights to ensure robust behavior across different obstacle settings and movement durations. Evaluations on an anthropomorphic robotic system demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.},

abstract = {This minibook was created because system dynamics courses in the standard mechanical engineering curriculum do not cover fluid power, even though fluid power is essential to mechanical engineering and students entering the work force are likely to encounter fluid power systems in their job. Most sys- tem dynamics textbooks have a chapter or part of a chapter on fluid power but typically the chapter is thin and does not cover practical fluid power as is used in industry today. For example, many textbooks confine their discus- sion of fluid power to liquid tank systems and never even mention hydraulic cylinders, the workhorse of today's practical fluid power. The material is intended for use in an introductory system dynamics course that would teach analysis of mechanical translational, mechanical rotary and electrical system using differential equations, transfer functions and time and frequency response. The material should be introduced toward the end of the course after the other domains and most of the analysis methods have been covered. It replaces or supplements any coverage of fluid power in the course textbook. The instruction can pick and choose which sections will be covered in class or read by the student. At the University of Minnesota, the material is used in course ME 3281, System Dynamics and Control. This project is a result of the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power (CCEFP) (www.ccefp.org), a National Science Foundation Engineering Re- search Center founded in 2006. The center conducts basic and applied re- search in fluid power with three thrust areas: efficiency, compactness, and usability. The center has over 50 industrial affiliates and its research is ul- timately intended to be used in next generation fluid power products. To ensure the material in the minibook is current and relevant, it was reviewed by industry representatives and academics affiliated with the center.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our recent results in the development of a new class of soft, continuous backbone (“continuum”) robot manipulators. Our work is strongly motivated by the dexterous appendages found in cephalopods, particularly the arms and suckers of octopus, and the arms and tentacles of squid. Our ongoing investigation of these animals reveals interesting and unexpected functional aspects of their structure and behavior. The arrangement and dynamic operation of muscles and connective tissue observed in the arms of a variety of octopus species motivate the underlying design approach for our soft manipulators. These artificial manipulators feature biomimetic actuators, including artificial muscles based on both electro-active polymers (EAP) and pneumatic (McKibben) muscles. They feature a “clean” continuous backbone design, redundant degrees of freedom, and exhibit significant compliance that provides novel operational capacities during environmental interaction and object manipulation. The unusual compliance and redundant degrees of freedom provide strong potential for application to delicate tasks in cluttered and/or unstructured environments. Our aim is to endow these compliant robotic mechanisms with the diverse and dexterous grasping behavior observed in octopuses. To this end, we are conducting fundamental research into the manipulation tactics, sensory biology, and neural control of octopuses. This work in turn leads to novel approaches to motion planning and operator interfaces for the robots. The paper describes the above efforts, along with the results of our development of a series of continuum tentacle-like robots, demonstrating the unique abilities of biologically-inspired design.},

abstract = {Many kinds of power assist device have been developed. By using the exoskeleton, a high generated torque actuator can be introduced. An assistance performance of these devices becomes high. On the other hand, a realization of exoskeleton which has the same D.O.F of a human is not easy from considerations about a size and strength of device. The purpose of this study is to develop power assist device which is easy to use like normal clothes and does not restrict movement even though the assistance rate is not so high. User can be assisted by wearing this one on which the pneumatic soft actuator, which has a high power weight ratio and a light weight, is put. Final goal of this wear is to reduce a physical burden caused by heavy equipment such as a heatproof suit for a firefighter and so on. In this paper, the structure of power assist wear is discussed, and the assistance effect under the condition that a heavy load is applied to upper body is verified from iEMG.},

abstract = {Evaluation and testing are critical for the development of Automated Vehicles (AVs). Currently, companies test AVs on public roads, which is very time-consuming and inefficient. We proposed the Accelerated Evaluation concept which uses a modified statistics of the surrounding vehicles and the Importance Sampling theory to reduce the evaluation time by several orders of magnitude, while ensuring the final evaluation results are accurate. In this paper, we further extend this idea by using Piecewise Mixture Distribution models instead of Single Distribution models. We demonstrate this idea to evaluate vehicle safety in lane change scenarios. The behavior of the cut-in vehicles was modeled based on more than 400,000 naturalistic driving lane changes collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. Simulation results confirm that the accuracy and efficiency of the Piecewise Mixture Distribution method are better than the single distribution.},

The results conducted using a healthy subject showed sufficient performance for the execution of daily life activities, namely a pinch force of 20 N, a wrap grasp force of 40 N, and a maximum grasped object size of 76 mm. The use of an underactuation mechanism enabled the grasping of objects of various shapes without active control. A subject suffering from paralysis of the hands due to a spinal cord injury was able to use the glove to grasp objects of various shapes.},

Our method is applicable for LRFs which measure only a single plane. It does not rely on observing the laser plane in the camera image. Instead, we show that point-to-plane constraints from a single observation of a V-shaped calibration pattern composed of two non-coplanar triangles suffice to uniquely constrain the transformation. Next, we present a method to obtain a solution using point-to-plane constraints from single or multiple observations. Along the way, we also show that previous solutions, in contrast to our method, have inherent ambiguities and therefore must rely on a good initial estimate. Real and synthetic experiments validate our method and show that it achieves better accuracy than previous methods.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0 {\%} which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2 {\%} achieved by the second-best entry. 1},

@article{Massiceti2016,
abstract = {This work addresses the task of camera localization in a known 3D scene given a single input RGB image. State-of-the-art approaches accomplish this in two steps: firstly, regressing for every pixel in the image its 3D scene coordinate and subsequently, using these coordinates to estimate the final 6D camera pose via RANSAC. To solve the first step, Random Forests (RFs) are typically used. On the other hand, Neural Networks (NNs) reign in many dense regression tasks, but are not test-time efficient. We ask the question: which of the two is best for camera localization? To address this, we make two method contributions: (1) a test-time efficient NN architecture which we term a ForestNet that is derived and initialized from a RF, and (2) a new fully-differentiable robust averaging technique for regression ensembles which can be trained end-to-end with a NN. Our experimental findings show that for scene coordinate regression, traditional NN architectures are superior to test-time efficient RFs and ForestNets, however, this does not translate to final 6D camera pose accuracy where RFs and ForestNets perform slightly better. To summarize, our best method, a ForestNet with a robust average, which has an equivalent fast and lightweight RF, improves over the state-of-the-art for camera localization on the 7-Scenes dataset. While this work focuses on scene coordinate regression for camera localization, our innovations may also be applied to other continuous regression tasks.},

Soft actuators comprised of elastomeric materials with integrated channels that function as pneumatic networks (PneuNets), are designed and geometrically analyzed to produce bending motions that can safely conform with the human finger motion. Bending curvature and force response of these actuators are investigated using geometrical analysis and a finite element model (FEM) prior to fabrication. The fabrication procedure of the chosen actuator is described followed by a series of experiments that mechanically characterize the actuators. The experimental data is compared to results obtained from FEM simulations showing good agreement. Finally, an open-palm glove design and the integration of the actuators to it are described, followed by a qualitative evaluation study.},

abstract = {We propose a 3D obstacle avoidance method for mobile robots. Besides the robot's 2D laser range finder, a Time-of-Flight camera is used to perceive obstacles that are not in the scan plane of the laser range finder. Existing approaches that employ Time-of-Flight cameras suffer from the limited field-of-view of the sensor. To overcome this issue, we mount the camera on the head of our anthropomorphic robot Dynamaid. This allows to change the gaze direction through the robot's pan-tilt neck and its torso yaw joint. The proposed obstacle detection method is robust against kinematic inaccuracies and noise in the range measurements. The gaze controller takes motion blur effects into account and controls the gaze depending on the robot's motion and the obstacles in its vicinity. In experiments, we demonstrate that our approach enables the robot to avoid obstacles that the laser range finder can not perceive. We also compare our active gaze control strategy with a fixed gaze orientation.},

Three types of silicone materials, Ecoflex 0030 and 0050 and Dragonskin 0030, have been investigated, and a constitutive model has been derived for each of them. Design optimization of the silicone module was based on finite element analysis (FEA) that was validated against experimental data of one-degree bending under one-channel actuation. This was followed by FEA parametric studies for module design optimization to minimize the ballooning effect in one-degree bending as well as reduce the actuation pressure. Modules made from Ecoflex 0030 and Ecoflex 0050 exhibited the same bending shape in FEA, but about three times higher actuation pressure was required for the harder Ecoflex 0050. Design parameters under investigation in the parametric FEA studies included the sha...},

abstract = {We address the problem of foothold selection in robotic legged locomotion over very rough terrain. The difficulty of the problem we address here is comparable to that of human rock-climbing, where foot/hand-hold selection is one of the most critical aspects. Previous work in this domain typically involves defining a reward function over footholds as a weighted linear combination of terrain features. However, a significant amount of effort needs to be spent in designing these features in order to model more complex decision functions, and hand-tuning their weights is not a trivial task. We propose the use of terrain templates, which are discretized height maps of the terrain under a foothold on different length scales, as an alternative to manually designed features. We describe an algorithm that can simultaneously learn a small set of templates and a foothold ranking function using these templates, from expert-demonstrated footholds. Using the LittleDog quadruped robot, we experimentally show that the use of terrain templates can produce complex ranking functions with higher performance than standard terrain features, and improved generalization to unseen terrain.},

Much research has been done in the way of obstacle avoidance, terrain classification, and path planning, but still so few UGV systems can accurately traverse off-road environments at high speeds autonomously. One of the most dangerous hazards found off-road are negative obstacles, mainly because they are so difficult to detect. We present algorithms that analyze the terrain using a point cloud produced by a 3D laser range finder, then attempt to classify the negative obstacles using both a geometry-based method we call the Negative Obstacle DetectoR (NODR) as well as a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The terrain is analyzed with respect to a large UGV with the sensor mounted up high as well as a small UGV with the sensor mounted low to the ground.},

abstract = {Future humanoid robots will be expected to carry out a wide range of tasks for which they had not been originally equipped by learning new skills and adapting to their environment. A crucial requirement towards that goal is to be able to take advantage of external elements as tools to perform tasks for which their own manipulators are insufficient; the ability to autonomously learn how to use tools will render robots far more versatile and simpler to design. Motivated by this prospect, this paper proposes and evaluates an approach to allow robots to learn tool affordances based on their 3D geometry. To this end, we apply tool-pose descriptors to represent tools combined with the way in which they are grasped, and affordance vectors to represent the effect tool-poses achieve in function of the action performed. This way, tool affordance learning consist in determining the mapping between these 2 representations, which is achieved in 2 steps. First, the dimensionality of both representations is reduced by unsupervisedly mapping them onto respective Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Then, the mapping between the neurons in the tool-pose SOM and the neurons in the affordance SOM for pairs of tool-poses and their corresponding affordance vectors, respectively, is learned with a neural based regression model. This method enables the robot to accurately predict the effect of its actions using tools, and thus to select the best action for a given goal, even with previously unseen tools.},

abstract = {Social demand for exoskeleton robots that physically assist humans has been increasing in various situations due to the demographic trends of aging populations. With exoskeleton robots, an assistive strategy is a key ingredient. Since interactions between users and exoskeleton robots are bidirectional, the assistive strategy design problem is complex and challenging. In this paper, we explore a data– driven learning approach for designing assistive strategies for exoskeletons from user-robot physical interaction. We formulate the learning problem of assistive strategies as a policy search problem and exploit a data-efficient model-based reinforcement learning framework. Instead of explicitly providing the desired trajectories in the cost function, our cost function only considers the user's muscular effort measured by electromyography signals (EMGs) to learn the assistive strategies. The key underlying assumption is that the user is instructed to perform the task by his/her own intended movements. Since the EMGs are observed when the intended movements are achieved by the user's own muscle efforts rather than the robot's assistance, EMGs can be interpreted as the “cost” of the current assistance. We applied our method to a 1-DoF exoskeleton robot and conducted a series of experiments with human subjects. Our experimental results demonstrated that our method learned proper assistive strategies that explicitly considered the bidirectional interactions between a user and a robot with only 60 sec- onds of interaction. We also showed that our proposed method can cope with changes in both the robot dynamics and movement trajectories.},

We demonstrate, for the first time, that COCoMoPL works on a real humanoid robot, here HRP-2 with 36 DOF and 30 position controlled actuators. To this end, it was necessary to significantly extend the existing approach by including transition steps into the training data, modify the movement primitives (MP) to admit these transitions, improve the representation of the ZMP MPs and tighten the transition conditions at the beginning and end of steps. We present a thorough validation of the method in simulation and on the real robot for a challenging sequence of movements.

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on large scale RGB databases have become the secret sauce in the majority of recent approaches for object categorization from RGB-D data. Thanks to colorization techniques, these methods exploit the filters learned from 2D images to extract meaningful representations in 2.5D. Still, the perceptual signature of these two kind of images is very different, with the first usually strongly characterized by textures, and the second mostly by silhouettes of objects. Ideally, one would like to have two CNNs, one for RGB and one for depth, each trained on a suitable data collection, able to capture the perceptual properties of each channel for the task at hand. This has not been possible so far, due to the lack of a suitable depth database. This paper addresses this issue, proposing to opt for synthetically generated images rather than collecting by hand a 2.5D large scale database. While being clearly a proxy for real data, synthetic images allow to trade quality for quantity, making it possible to generate a virtually infinite amount of data. We show that the filters learned from such data collection, using the very same architecture typically used on visual data, learns very different filters, resulting in depth features (a) able to better characterize the different facets of depth images, and (b) complementary with respect to those derived from CNNs pre-trained on 2D datasets. Experiments on two publicly available databases show the power of our approach.},

abstract = {—In imitation learning, multivariate Gaussians are widely used to encode robot behaviors. Such approaches do not provide the ability to properly represent end-effector orientation, as the distance metric in the space of orientations is not Euclidean. In this work we present an extension of common imitation learning techniques to Riemannian manifolds. This generalization enables the encoding of joint distributions that include the robot pose. We show that Gaussian conditioning, Gaussian product and nonlinear regression can be achieved with this representation. The proposed approach is illustrated with examples on a 2-dimensional sphere, with an example of regression between two robot end-effector poses, as well as an extension of Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) to Riemannian manifolds.},

abstract = {The basic concepts for exoskeletal systems have been suggested for some time with applications ranging from construction, manufacturing and mining to rescue and emer- gency services. In recent years, research has been driven by possible uses in medi- cal/rehabilitation and military applications. Yet there are still significant barriers to the effective use and exploitation of this technology. Among the most pertinent of these factors is the power and actuation system and its impact of control, strength, speed and, perhaps most critically, safety. This work describes the design, construction and test- ing of an ultra low-mass, full-body exoskeleton system having seven degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the upper limbs and five degrees of freedom (DOFs) for each of the lower limbs. This low mass is primarily due to the use of a new range of pneumatic muscle actuators as the power source for the system. The work presented will show how the system takes advantage of the inherent controllable compliance to produce a unit that is powerful, providing a wide range of functionality (motion and forces over an extended range) in a manner that has high safety integrity for the user. The general layout of both the upper and the lower body exoskeleton is presented together with results from preliminary experiments to demonstrate the potential of the device in limb retraining, rehabilitation and power assist (augmentation) operations.},

abstract = {Spiral welding or bonding is a particularly efficient and cost-effective method of constructing continuous tubes. However the understanding of the mechanics of such structures is not yet well developed. This is in no small part due to the difficulties involved in their computational analysis. Cylindrical shells are traditionally modelled using rectangular finite elements oriented parallel to the meridional and circumferential axes. However, spiral features are particularly challenging to model because such features are not orthogonal to the axes of the cylinder. Commercial finite element pre-processors often struggle to mesh these with anything other than a free triangulation. A superior mesh would consist of well-conditioned rectangular elements oriented orthogonally with respect to the axes of the helix, termed a 'helical mesh', but this requires significant programming effort. A helical mesh is particularly important if features of the shell such as geometric imperfections, residual stresses, weld material and heat affected zones, and bonding in systems using adhesives are required to follow the helical form. Helically wound structural forms are widely used in different applications that demand continuous cylindrical forms. The most common uses in structural engineering are in spiral wound tubes, piles, chimneys and pipelines. This paper describes a powerful computational procedure developed by the authors to generate high quality helical meshes. Special emphasis is placed on the modelling of geometric deviations defined relative to the helix, appropriate for the analysis of spiral welded and stiffened tubes. The effect of helical meshing is illustrated using benchmark examples of perfect and imperfect cylinders under axial compression. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Neo-Hookean model and Mooney-Rivlin model are hyperelastic material models where the strain energy density function is made from invariants of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. Even though Ogden model is a hyperelastic material model, its strain energy density function is expressed by principal stretch ratio. These three models have been widely used in industries. Recently, Ogden model, especially Ogden 3rd model, shows better agreement with the test data than others. In spite of the limitations to describe particular stress states, it is known that reasonable results using these models can be obtained for various structural components. In this research, three kinds of models are considered for Chloroprene rubber. Three kinds of tests (Uniaxial tension test, Biaxial tension test, and Planar shear test) are performed for Chloroprene specimen and through four kinds of test combinations (Uni+Bi, Uni+Pl, Bi+Pl, Uni+Bi+Pl), numerical simulations are carried out for Neo-Hookean model, Mooney-Rivlin model, and Ogden model. It is shown that Mooney-Rivlin model and Ogden model can be used for Chloroprene Rubber in the specific ranges for Isotropic Hyperelastic model. {\textcopyright} KSPE and Springer 2012.},

Sensor system was designed to measure gait phases that was realized using FSR sensors and to measure lower limb joint angles that was realized using a fusion of gyroscope and accelerometer-based tilt angle sensor. In order to remove measurement error due to bias error of the gyroscope and fluctuation of tilt sensor, Kalman filter was used to estimate true lower limb joint angles. Each system was tested separately. Testing was done by measuring the stimulator's output on the tibialis anterior muscle stimulation in normal subjects. The characteristics of pulse train in accordance with the desired specifications and capable of producing contractions in the tibialis anterior muscle.

The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Shoulder rotator cuff impingement syndrome is a common and disabling problem for the wheelchair athlete. In this study we investigated the role of shoulder strength imbalance as a factor for the development of this syndrome. Nineteen paraplegic male athletes underwent clinical and isokinetic examination of both shoulders with peak torque values measured in abduction, adduction, and internal and external rotation. Twenty athletic, able-bodied men without shoulder problems were tested as controls. Ten (26{\%}) of the paraplegic athletes had rotator cuff impingement syndrome. The results of the isokinetic testing demonstrated that 1) the paraplegics' shoulders were stronger than the controls in all directions (P {\textless} 0.05); 2) the strength ratio of abduction: adduction was higher for paraplegic athletes (P {\textless} 0.05); 3) paraplegics' shoulders with rotator cuff impingement syndrome were weaker in adduction and external and internal rotation than the paraplegic athletes without impingement syndrome (P {\textless} 0.05); and 4) paraplegics' shoulders with rotator cuff impingement syndrome had higher abduction:adduction and abduction:internal rotation strength ratios than the shoulders of paraplegics without impingement syndrome (P {\textless} 0.05). We concluded that shoulder muscle imbalance, with comparative weakness of the humeral head depressors (rotators and adductors), may be a factor in the development and perpetuation of rotator cuff impingement syndrome in wheelchair athletes.},

abstract = {This paper describes a CMOS-based time-of-flight depth sensor and presents some experimental data while addressing various issues arising from its use. Our system is a single-chip solution based on a special CMOS pixel structure that can extract phase information from the received light pulses. The sensor chip integrates a 64x64 pixel array with a high-speed clock generator and ADC. A unique advantage of the chip is that it can be manufactured with an ordinary CMOS process. Compared with other types of depth sensors reported in the literature, our solution offers significant advantages, including superior accuracy, high frame rate, cost effectiveness and a drastic reduction in processing required to construct the depth maps. We explain the factors that determine the resolution of our system, discuss various problems that a time-of-flight depth sensor might face, and propose practical solutions.},

Softness, flexibility, and variable stiffness in robotics have been recognized as highly desirable characteristics for many applications. A number of solutions were proposed ranging from entirely soft robots (such as those composed mainly from soft materials such as silicone), via flexible continuum and snake-like robots, to rigid-link robots enhanced by joints that exhibit an elastic behavior either implemented in hardware or achieved purely by means of intelligent control. Although these are very good solutions paving the path to safe human–robot interaction, we propose here a new approach that focuses on creating stiffness controllability for the linkages between the robot joints.

Two different assistive strategies were evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.25 m/s with a 23.8 kg backpack: 1) hip extension assistance and 2) multi-joint assistance (hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion). Results show that the exosuit introduces minimum changes to kinematics and reduces biological joint moments. A reduction trend in muscular activity was observed for both conditions. On average, the exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 0.21 ± 0.04 W/kg and 0.67 ± 0.09 W/kg for hip extension assistance and multi-joint assistance respectively, which is equivalent to an average metabolic reduction of 4.6{\%} and 14.6{\%} demonstrating that soft exosuits can effectively improve human walking efficiency during load carriage without affecting natural walking gait. Moreover, it indicates that actuating multiple joints with soft exosuits provides a significant benefit to muscular activity and metabolic cost compared to actuating single joint.},

abstract = {In this project, I researched the kinematic analysis of robot arm. The kinematic analysis is the relationships between the positions, velocities, and accelerations of the links of a manipulator. The kinematics separate in two types, direct kinematics and inverse kinemtics. In forward kinematics, the length of each link and the angle of each joint is given and we have to calculate the position of any point in the work volume of the robot. In inverse kinematics, the length of each link and position of the point in work volume is given and we have to calculate the angle of each joint. The forward kinemtic analysis is not difficult to solve. It is solved by using simple homogeneous matrices. On the other hand, the inverse kinematics is so hard to solve and it will be harder if we increase the freesom degrees. There are different method to solve the inverse kinemtics. The analytic method and Jacobian method are well-known. In the project I used the analytic method. In the thesis aplication, I designed a prototype robot arm with 3 freedom degrees. User interface application was created in the personal computer and the data was sended the hardware application board by using serial communication cable. The program that runs over the application board receives the data and operates. So the grapper can be moved the position we want to go.},

abstract = {Robotic-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) can benefit from the automation of common, repetitive or well-defined but ergonomically difficult tasks. One such task is the scanning of a pick-up endomicroscopy probe over a complex, undulating tissue surface in order to enhance the effective field-of-view through video mosaicing. In this paper, the da Vinci surgical robot, through the dVRK framework, is used for autonomous scanning and 2D mosaicing over a user-defined region of interest. To achieve the level of precision required for high quality large-area mosaic generation, which relies on sufficient overlap between consecutive image frames, visual servoing is performed using a tracking marker attached to the probe. The resulting sub-millimetre accuracy of the probe motion allows for the generation of large endomicroscopy mo- saics with minimal intervention from the surgeon. It also allows the probe to be maintained in an orientation perpendicular to the local tissue surface, providing optimal imaging results. Images are streamed from the endomicroscope and overlaid live onto the surgeons view, while 2D mosaics are generated in real-time, and fused into a 3D stereo reconstruction of the surgical scene, thus providing intuitive visualisation and fusion of the multi-scale images. The system therefore offers significant potential to enhance surgical procedures, by providing the operator with cellular-scale information over a larger area than could typically be achieved by manual scanning.},

abstract = {Manipulators based on soft robotic technologies exhibit compliance and dexterity which ensures safe human–robot interaction. This article is a novel attempt at exploiting these desirable properties to develop a manipulator for an assistive application, in particular, a shower arm to assist the elderly in the bathing task. The overall vision for the soft manipulator is to concatenate three modules in a serial manner such that (i) the proximal segment is made up of cable-based actuation to compensate for gravitational effects and (ii) the central and distal segments are made up of hybrid actuation to autonomously reach delicate body parts to perform the main tasks related to bathing. The role of the latter modules is crucial to the application of the system in the bathing task; however, it is a nontrivial challenge to develop a robust and controllable hybrid actuated system with advanced manipulation capabilities and hence, the focus of this article. We first introduce our design and experimentally characterize its functionalities, which include elongation, shortening, omnidirectional bending. Next, we propose a control concept capable of solving the inverse kinetics problem using multiagent reinforcement learning to exploit these functionalities despite high dimensionality and redundancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the design and control of this module by demonstrating an open-loop task space control where it successfully moves through an asymmetric 3-D trajectory sampled at 12 points with an average reaching accuracy of 0.79 cm ± 0.18 cm. Our quantitative experimental results present a promising step toward the development of the soft manipulator eventually contributing to the advancement of soft robotics.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the novel concept of performance-based progressive robot therapy that uses speed, time, or EMG thresholds to initiate robot assistance. We pioneered the clinical application of robot-assisted therapy focusing on stroke—the largest cause of disability in the US. We have completed several clinical studies involving well over 200 stroke patients. Research to date has shown that repetitive task-specific, goal-directed, robot-assisted therapy is effective in reducing motor impairments in the affected arm after stroke. One research goal is to determine the optimal therapy tailored to each stroke patient that will maximize his/her recovery. A proposed method to achieve this goal is a novel performance-based impedance control algorithm, which is triggered via speed, time, or EMG. While it is too early to determine the effectiveness of the algorithm, therapists have already noted one very strong benefit, a significant reduction in arm tone.},

abstract = {Prototype fingertips using electrorheological (ER) fluids with elementary tactile sensing were fabricated and tested. The fingertips consist of a layer of ER fluid sandwiched between a grounded elastomer skin and a positively charged electrode. This arrangement forms a capacitor whose value increases as the elastomer is deflected toward the positive electrode. The ER fingertips can be put on a robot gripper or the fingers of a dextrous robot hand. The fluid layer acts as a soft conformal pad when the voltage is turned off. When energized, the fluid changes from a Newtonian fluid to a Bingham plastic with a yield stress of a few kPa. The result is a finger with simple tactile sensing and the ability to generate large lifting forces with small grasp forces, due to interlocking between the deformed skin/solidified fluid and the gripped object. A gripper with ER fingertips was able to grip a raw egg gently using capacitance sensing. The authors examine the improved lifting force available with ER fingertips over passive designs. The design of a multielement fingertip for shape sensing is investigated and recommendations are offered for designing practical ER robotic hands},

We propose a new account of how space-time mappings become activated in individuals' minds and entrenched in their cultures, the temporal-focus hypothesis: People should conceptualize either the future or the past as in front of them to the extent that their culture (or subculture) is future oriented or past oriented. Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people's minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

The goal is to develop a robust approach which does not rely on: (a) communication links between the MAVs, (b) the knowledge of the payload shape and (c) the position of grasping point. The proposed approach is based on the master-slave paradigm, in which the slave agent guarantees compliance to the external force applied by the master to the payload via an admittance controller. The external force acting on the slave is estimated using a non-linear estimator based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) from the information provided by a visual inertial navigation system. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the force estimator and show the collaborative transportation of a 1.2 m long object.},

In this paper we present a probability based solution for map building which utilizes time of flight information from an ultrasonic sensor. In contrast to most of the available map building systems, this uses a single ultrasonic sensor, mounted on a rotating shaft. Discrete sonar observations taken at regular time intervals, by rotating the shaft in small step angles are incrementally merged into partial planes to produce a realistic representation of environment that is amenable to sonar localization. Readings of close proximity are averaged to suppress the transient errors and the results are further refined by using the sonar probability model to fill an occupancy grid and Bayesian combination for the purpose of data fusion. Experimental results obtained in a real indoor environment are presented to verify the validity of our algorithm.},

Robotic stroke therapy will be more effective if hand and upper-arm training is integrated to help users practice reaching and grasping tasks. This article presents the design, development, and validation of a low-cost, functional electrical stimulation grasp-assistive glove for use with task-oriented robotic stroke therapy. Our glove measures grasp aperture while a user completes simple-to-complex real-life activities, and when combined with an integrated functional electrical stimulator, it assists in hand opening and closing. A key function is a new grasp-aperture prediction model, which uses the position of the end-effectors of two planar robots to define the distance between the thumb and index finger. We validated the accuracy and repeatability of the glove and its capability to assist in grasping. Results from five nondisabled subjects indicated that the glove is accurate and repeatable for both static hand-open and -closed tasks when compared with goniometric measures and for dynamic reach-to-grasp tasks when compared with motion analysis measures. Results from five subjects with stroke showed that with the glove, they could open their hands but without it could not. We present a glove that is a low-cost solution for in vivo grasp measurement and assistance.},

In order to learn semantically meaningful spaces throughout our network, we introduce a method for pre-training its lower layers for multimodal feature embedding and a method for fine-tuning this embedding space using a loss-based margin.

Stroke is a clinical illness resulting in long lasting neurological deficits often affecting somatosensory and motor cortices. More than half of those that recover from a stroke survive with disability in their upper arm and need rehabilitation therapy to help in regaining functions of daily living. In this paper, we demonstrated a prototype of a low-cost, ultra-light and wearable soft robotic assistive device that could aid administration of elbow motion therapies to stroke patients. In order to assist the rotation of the elbow joint, the soft modules which consist of soft wedge-like cellular units was inflated by air to produce torque at the elbow joint. Highly compliant rotation can be naturally realised by the elastic property of soft silicone and pneumatic control of air. Based on the direct visual-actuation control, a higher control loop utilised visual processing to apply positional control, the lower control loop was implemented by an electronic circuit to achieve the desired pressure of the soft modules by Pulse Width Modulation. To examine the functionality of the proposed soft modular system, we used an anatomical model of the upper limb and performed the experiments with healthy participants.},

abstract = {Robots that can operate in human environments in a safe and robust manner would be of great benefit to society, due to their immense potential for providing assistance to humans. However, robots have seen limited application outside of the industrial setting in environments such as homes and hospitals. We believe a very important factor preventing the cross over of robotic technology from the factory to the house is the issue of safety. The safety issue is usually bypassed in the industrial setting by separation of human and robot workspaces. Such a solution is clearly infeasible for robots that provide assistance to humans. This thesis aims to develop intrinsically safe robots that are suitable for providing assistance to humans. We believe intrinsic safety is important in physical human robot interaction because unintended interactions will occur between humans and robots due to: (a) sharing of workspace, (b) hardware failure (computer crashes, actuator failures), (c) limitations on perception, and (d) limitations on cognition. When such unintended interactions are very fast (collisions), they are beyond the bandwidth limits of practical controllers and only the intrinsic safety characteristics of the system govern the interaction forces that occur. The effects of such interactions with traditional robots could range from persistent discomfort to bone fracture to even serious injuries. Therefore robots that serve in the application domain of human assistance should be able to function with a high tolerance for unintended interactions. This calls for a new design paradigm where operational safety is the primary concern and task accuracy/precision though important are secondary. In this thesis, we address this new design paradigm by developing robots that have a soft inflatable structure, i.e, inflatable robots. Inflatable robots can improve intrinsic safety characteristics by being extremely lightweight and by including surface compliance (due to the compressibility of air) as well as distributed structural compliance (due to the lower Young's modulus of the materials used) in the structure. This results in a lower effective inertia during collisions which implies a lower impact force between the inflatable robot and human. Inflatable robots can essentially be manufactured like clothes and can therefore also potentially lower the cost of robots to an extent where personal robots can be an affordable reality. In this thesis, we present a number of inflatable robot prototypes to address challenges in the area of design and control of such systems. Specific areas addressed are: structural and joint design, payload capacity, pneumatic actuation, state estimation and control: The CMU inflatable arm is used in tasks like wiping and feeding a human to successfully demonstrate the use of inflatable robots for tasks involving close physical human interaction.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the effects of robot-assisted movement training with conventional techniques for the rehabilitation of upper-limb motor function after stroke. Design: Randomized controlled trial, 6-month follow-up. Setting: A Department of Veterans Affairs rehabilitation research and development center. Participants: Consecutive sample of 27 subjects with chronic hemiparesis ({\textgreater}6mo after cerebrovascular accident) randomly allocated to group. Interventions: All subjects received twenty-four 1-hour sessions over 2 months. Subjects in the robot group practiced shoulder and elbow movements while assisted by a robot manipulator. Subjects in the control group received neurodevelopmental therapy (targeting proximal upper limb function) and 5 minutes of exposure to the robot in each session. Main Outcome Measures: Fugl-Meyer assessment of motor impairment, FIM??? instrument, and biomechanic measures of strength and reaching kinematics. Clinical evaluations were performed by a therapist blinded to group assignments. Results: Compared with the control group, the robot group had larger improvements in the proximal movement portion of the Fugl-Meyer test after 1 month of treatment (P{\textless}.05) and also after 2 months of treatment (P{\textless}.05). The robot group had larger gains in strength (P{\textless}.02) and larger increases in reach extent (P{\textless}.01) after 2 months of treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, the groups no longer differed in terms of the Fugl-Meyer test (P{\textgreater}.30); however, the robot group had larger improvements in the FIM (P{\textless}.04). Conclusions: Compared with conventional treatment, robot- assisted movements had advantages in terms of clinical and biomechanical measures. Further research into the use of robotic manipulation for motor rehabilitation is justified. ?? 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Most visual odometry algorithm for a monocular camera focuses on points, either by feature matching, or direct alignment of pixel intensity, while ignoring a common but important geometry entity: edges. In this paper, we propose an odometry algorithm that combines points and edges to benefit from the advantages of both direct and feature based methods. It works better in texture-less environments and is also more robust to lighting changes and fast motion by increasing the convergence basin. We maintain a depth map for the keyframe then in the tracking part, the camera pose is recovered by minimizing both the photometric error and geometric error to the matched edge in a probabilistic framework. In the mapping part, edge is used to speed up and increase stereo matching accuracy. On various public datasets, our algorithm achieves better or comparable performance than state-of-the-art monocular odometry methods. In some challenging texture-less environments, our algorithm reduces the state estimation error over 50{\%}.},

abstract = {Gripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most current designs are based on the multifingered hand, but this approach introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum the granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less than 0.5{\%} suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms, friction, suction, and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force. Using a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the jammed state. This advance opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet highly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects.},

The design principle is based on the unique antagonistic arrangement of radial/circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaeta. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure with NiTi coil actuators. A numerical model for the mesh structure describes how peristaltic motion induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of locomotion speed. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impacts during locomotion. This approach can enable a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources.},

abstract = {Soft robots are often inspired from biological systems which consist of soft materials or are actuated by electrically activated materials. There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews state-of-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, fluidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The de-formable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are prefer-able for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus ({\textless} 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material filled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials {\&} fabrication methods are described in this review arti-cle. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

Our algorithm proposes solutions to three different challenges that arise in learning to improve planning efficiency: what to predict, how to represent a planning problem instance, and how to transfer knowledge from one problem instance to another. We propose a method that predicts constraints on the search space based on a generic representation of a planning problem instance, called score space, where we represent a problem instance in terms of performance of a set of solutions attempted so far. Using this representation, we transfer knowledge, in the form of constraints, from previous problems based on the similarity in score space. We design a sequential algorithm that efficiently predicts these constraints, and evaluate it in three different challenging task and motion planning problems. Results indicate that our approach perform orders of magnitudes faster than an unguided planner.},

abstract = {This paper explores a new hybrid actuation principle combining pneumatic and tendon-driven actuators for a soft robotic manipulator. The fusion of these two actuation principles leads to an overall antagonistic actuation mechanism whereby pneumatic actuation opposes tendon actuation - a mechanism commonly found in animals where muscles can oppose each other to vary joint stiffness. We are taking especially inspiration from the octopus who belongs to the class of Cephalopoda; the octopus uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles in its arms to achieve varied motion patterns; activating both sets of muscles, the octopus can control the arm stiffness over a wide range. Our approach mimics this behavior and achieves comparable motion patterns, including bending, elongation and stiffening. The proposed method combines the advantages of tendon-driven and pneumatic actuated systems and goes beyond what current soft, flexible robots can achieve: because the new robot structure is effectively an inflatable, sleeve, it can be pumped up to its fully inflated volume and, also, completely deflated and shrunk. Since, in the deflated state, it comprises just its outer “skin” and tendons, the robot can be compressed to a very small size, many times smaller when compared to its fully-inflated state. In this paper, we describe the mechanical structure of the soft manipulator. Proof-of-concept experiments focus on the robot's ability to bend, to morph from completely shrunk to entirely inflated as well as to vary its stiffness.},

In contrast to existing curvature sensors that measure differential strain, sensors in this new class measure curvature directly and allow for arbitrary gauge factor and film thickness. Moreover, each sensor is composed entirely of a soft elastomer (PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) or Ecoflex) and conductive liquid (eutectic gallium indium, eGaIn) and thus remains functional even when stretched to several times its natural length. The electrical resistance in the embedded eGaIn microchannel is measured as a function of the bending curvature for a variety of sensor designs. In all cases, the experimental measurements are in reasonable agreement with closed-form algebraic approximations derived from elastic plate theory and Ohm's law. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The proposed approach provides an intuitive way to collect data and exhibits the following characteristics: task performing capability, task reiteration ability, generalizability, and easy applicability. The proposed approach utilizes a real-time user interface with a monitor and provides a first-person perspective using a head-mounted display. Through this interface, teleoperation is used for collecting task operating data, especially for tasks that are difficult to be applied with a conventional method. A two-phase deep learning model is also utilized in the proposed approach. A deep convolutional autoencoder extracts images features and reconstructs images, and a fully connected deep time delay neural network learns the dynamics of a robot task process from the extracted image features and motion angle signals. The “Nextage Open” humanoid robot is used as an experimental platform to evaluate the proposed model. The object folding task utilizing with 35 trained and 5 untrained sensory motor sequences for test. Testing the trained model with online generation demonstrates a 77.8{\%} success rate for the object folding task.},

abstract = {— A Spring-Loaded-Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has been applied to many legged robots, such as quadruped robots, for realizing trotting, bounding, and gal-loping motions. The indecipherable damping factors, however, hindered the implementation of the SLIP model in practice. In this work, a control algorithm is proposed to realize the ideal springy motion of a robotic leg. A Kalman filter with the reference system by a damped SLIP model is utilized for estimating the longitudinal velocity of a robotic leg (i.e., the length change rate between the proximal joint and the tip toe). By cancelling the undesired damping factors through positive feedback based on the Kalman filter estimate, the robotic leg is controlled to follow an undamped SLIP model. For the verification of the proposed method, the simulation model of an actual robotic leg is utilized. The simulation results showed that the proposed control algorithm enabled the robotic leg to keep continuously hopping as a spring even in the presence of nonlinear frictions.},

abstract = {Moving in an unstructured environment such as soil requires approaches that are constrained by the physics of this complex medium and can ensure energy efficiency and minimize friction while exploring and searching. Among living organisms, plants are the most efficient at soil exploration, and their roots show remarkable abilities that can be exploited in artificial systems. Energy efficiency and friction reduction are assured by a growth process wherein new cells are added at the root apex by mitosis while mature cells of the root remain stationary and in contact with the soil. We propose a new concept of root-like growing robots that is inspired by these plant root features. The device penetrates soil and develops its own structure using an additive layering technique: each layer of new material is deposited adjacent to the tip of the device. This deposition produces both a motive force at the tip and a hollow tubular structure that extends to the surface of the soil and is strongly anchored to the soil. The addition of material at the tip area facilitates soil penetration by omitting peripheral friction and thus decreasing the energy consumption down to 70{\%} comparing with penetration by pushing into the soil from the base of the penetration system. The tubular structure provides a path for delivering materials and energy to the tip of the system and for collecting information for exploratory tasks.},

We present a method for obtaining a labeled 2.5D grid map of the robot's surroundings. Each cell is marked either as floor or obstacle and contains a value telling the height of the floor or obstacle. Such height maps are useful for path planning and collision avoidance. The method uses a novel combination of a 3D occupancy grid for robust sensor data interpretation and a 2.5D height map for fine resolution floor values. We evaluate our approach using stereo vision on the humanoid robot QRIO and show the advantages over previous methods. Experimental results from navigation runs on an obstacle course demonstrate the ability of the method to generate detailed maps for autonomous navigation. },

abstract = {Robots can improve motor status after stroke with certain advantages, but there has been less emphasis to date on robotic developments for the hand. The goal of this study was to determine whether a hand-wrist robot would improve motor function, and to evaluate the specificity of therapy effects on brain reorganization. Subjects with chronic stroke producing moderate right arm/hand weakness received 3 weeks therapy that emphasized intense active movement repetition as well as attention, speed, force, precision and timing, and included virtual reality games. Subjects initiated hand movements. If necessary, the robot completed movements, a feature available at all visits for seven of the subjects and at the latter half of visits for six of the subjects. Significant behavioural gains were found at end of treatment, for example, in Action Research Arm Test (34 +/- 20 to 38 +/- 19, P{\textless} 0.0005) and arm motor Fugl-Meyer score (45 +/- 10 to 52 +/- 10, P {\textless} 0.0001). Results suggest greater gains for subjects receiving robotic assistance in all sessions as compared to those receiving robotic assistance in half of sessions. The grasp task practiced during robotic therapy, when performed during functional MRI, showed increased sensorimotor cortex activation across the period of therapy, while a non-practiced task, supination/pronation, did not. A robot-based therapy showed improvements in hand motor function after chronic stroke. Reorganization of motor maps during the current therapy was task-specific, a finding useful when considering generalization of rehabilitation therapy.},

The proposed control scheme is used to compute the motion of a camera whose task is to successively observe a set of robots for measuring their position and improving the accuracy of their localization. This method is based on the prediction of an uncertainty model (due to actuation and measurement noise) for determining which robot has to be observed by the camera.

abstract = {Robot awareness of human actions is an essential research problem in robotics with many important real-world applications, including human-robot collaboration and teaming. Over the past few years, depth sensors have become a standard device widely used by intelligent robots for 3D perception, which can also offer human skeletal data in 3D space. Several methods based on skeletal data were designed to enable robot awareness of human actions with satisfactory accuracy. However, previous methods treated all body parts and features equally important, without the capability to identify discriminative body parts and features. In this paper, we propose a novel simultaneous Feature And Body-part Learning (FABL) approach that simultaneously identifies discriminative body parts and features, and efficiently integrates all available information together to enable real-time robot awareness of human behaviors. We formulate FABL as a regression-like optimization problem with structured sparsity-inducing norms to model interrelationships of body parts and features. We also develop an optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem, which possesses a theoretical guarantee to find the optimal solution. To evaluate FABL, three experiments were performed using public benchmark datasets, including the MSR Action3D and CAD-60 datasets, as well as a Baxter robot in practical assistive living applications. Experimental results show that our FABL approach obtains a high recognition accuracy with a processing speed of the order-of-magnitude of 10e4 Hz, which makes FABL a promising method to enable real-time robot awareness of human behaviors in practical robotics applications.},

Specifically, we attempt to give a first step that towards finding the relationship between size-distance in depth perception in virtual environment. Depth perception has been shown to be key element and a major factor either for simple navigation tasks or for complex and dexterous manipulation tasks. However, in the history of psychology of perception few matters have been of more continuous interest than the issue of the relationship between perceived size and perceived distance. Most studies focused on such questions have converged upon a hypothesis named Size-Distance Invariance. This hypothesis is often stated in the following terms: A retinal projection or visual angle of given size determines a unique ratio of apparent size to apparent distance 1. The relationship between distance and size perception remains unclear in a virtual environment. The effectiveness of virtual environments has often been linked to the sense of presence that users feel in the virtual world. Moreover, Depth perception is one major factor among many believed to underlie presence for teleoperation and virtual environments. Our findings suggest that the strategy based on imagination of motor tasks could have a major effect on users accurate depth perception in virtual reality.},

abstract = {1,3 Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite—and perhaps because of—their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb's residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer's paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 ± 0.91° increase in the paretic ankle's swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 ± 3{\%} increase in the paretic limb's generation of forward propulsion (P {\textless} 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 ± 4{\%} reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 ± 3{\%} reduc-tion in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 ± 9{\%} reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance ({\~{}}12{\%} of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.},

A low-cost open-source consumer 3D printer and a commercially available printing material were identified for printing soft pneumatic actuators with complex inner geometry and high degree of freedom. We investigated the material properties of the printing material, simulated the mechanical behavior of the printed actuators, characterized the performances of the actuators in terms of their bending capability, output forces, as well as durability, and demonstrated the potential soft robotic applications of the 3D printed actuators.

Enabling this will allow the technology to perform meaningful tasks airborne, such as cleaning or grinding surfaces. While in contact and applying a large, continuous force, control of the UAV's attitude is a challenge. In this work, we show that a regular (PID-based) attitude controller is incapable of stabilizing aerial manipulators that apply physical contact forces on the environment that are comparable to the UAV's weight. We present a novel control algorithm that uses an LQR-optimized state feedback on the roll and yaw angle while in contact. Experiments on a UAV of 1.5 kg show that the proposed controller is capable of applying a contact force of over 15N —equal to the UAV's weight— sustained for several minutes.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a soft lower-extremity robotic exosuit intended to augment normal muscle function in healthy individuals. Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit's performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer's hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30{\%} of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject's average metabolic power was 386.7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381.8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430.6 W). This preliminary work demonstrates that the exosuit can comfortably transmit joint torques to the user while not restricting mobility and that with further optimization, has the potential to reduce the wearer's metabolic cost during walking.},

The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The system is constructed by a proper selection of components, and analyzed via the established pseudo-rigid-body model, based upon which the kinematic modelings are performed, and the CPM workspace is determined in view of the physical constraints. One of the advantages of the presented CPM is that it provides a regular like workspace with a maximum cuboid defined as usable workspace inscribed and one isotropic configuration involved. Moreover, the architecture design of the CPM to achieve a maximum usable workspace is carried out, and the dexterity performance is evaluated. Simulation results show that the compact CPM can perform a dexterous manipulation within the usable workspace. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {— We present an algorithm that generates walking motions for quadruped robots without the use of an explicit footstep planner by simultaneously optimizing over both the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory and the footholds. Feasibility is achieved by imposing stability constraints on the CoM related to the Zero Moment Point and explicitly enforcing kinematic constraints between the footholds and the CoM position. Given a desired goal state, the problem is solved online by a Nonlinear Programming solver to generate the walking motion. Experimental trials show that the algorithm is able to generate walking gaits for multiple steps in milliseconds that can be executed on a real quadruped robot.},

abstract = {Soft fluidic actuators consisting of elastomeric matrices with embedded flexible materials are of particular interest to the robotics community because they are affordable and can be easily customized to a given application. However, the significant potential of such actuators is currently limited as their design has typically been based on intuition. In this paper, the principle of operation of these actuators is comprehensively analyzed and described through experimentally validated quasi-static analytical and finite-element method models for bending in free space and force generation when in contact with an object. This study provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create soft actuators by understanding how these vary their outputs as a function of input pressure for a number of geometrical parameters. Additionally, the proposed analytical model is implemented in a controller demonstrating its ability to convert pressure information to bending angle in real time. Such an understanding of soft multimaterial actuators will allow future design concepts to be rapidly iterated and their performance predicted, thus enabling new and innovative applications that produce more complex motions to be explored},

abstract = {This thesis describes the development of high bandwidth ({\~{}}1 GHz) TOF (time-of-flight) laser range finder techniques for industrial measurement applications in the measurement range of zero to a few dozen metres to diffusely reflecting targets. The main goal has been to improve single-shot precision to mm-level in order to shorten the measurement result acquisition time. A TOF laser range finder consists of a laser transmitter, one or two receivers and timing discriminators, and a time measuring unit. In order to improve single-shot precision the slew-rate of the measurement pulse should be increased, so the optical pulse of the laser transmitter should be narrower and more powerful and the bandwidth of the receiver should be higher without increasing the noise level too much. In the transmitter usually avalanche transistors are used for generating the short (310 ns) and powerful (20100 A) current pulses for the semiconductor laser. Several avalanche transistor types were compared and the optimization of the switching circuit was studied. It was shown that as high as 130 A current pulses are achievable using commercially available surface mount avalanche transistors. The timing discriminator was noticed to give the minimum walk error, when high slew rate measurement pulses and a high bandwidth comparator were used. A walk error of less than 1 mm in an input amplitude dynamic range higher than 1:10 can be achieved with a high bandwidth receiver channel. Adding an external offset voltage between the input nodes of the comparator additionally minimized the walk error. A prototype {\~{}}1 GHz laser range finder constructed in the thesis consists of a laser pulser and two integrated ASIC receiver channels with silicon APDs (avalanche photodiodes), crossover timing discriminators and Gilbert cell attenuators. The laser pulser utilizes an internal Q-switching mode of a commercially available SH-laser and produces optical pulses with a pulse peak power and FWHM (full-width-at-half-maximum) of 44 W and 74 ps, respectively. Using single-axis optics and 1 m long multimode fibres between the optics and receivers a total accuracy of +/-2 mm in the measurement range of 0.534.5 m was measured. The single-shot precision ($\sigma$-value) was 14 ps34 ps (25 mm) in the measurement range. The single-shot precision agrees well with the simulations and is better with a factor of about 3-5 as compared to earlier published pulsed TOF laser radars in comparable measuring conditions.},

Motivated by the knowledge that human hand plays a very important role in the somatosensory system, we focused on the potential of the Cybergrasp device to improve perception in Virtual Reality worlds. We especially explored whether it is possible to distinguish objects with different elasticities.

The robotic system is made up of an embedded controller and a robotic hand module which can be adjusted to fit for different finger length. Eight chronic stroke subjects had been recruited to evaluate the effects of this device. The preliminary results showed significant improvement in hand functions (ARAT) and upper limb functions (FMA) after 20 sessions of robot-assisted hand functions task training. With the use of this light and portable robotic device, stroke patients can now practice more easily for the opening and closing of their hands at their own will, and handle functional daily living tasks at ease. A video is included together with this paper to give a demonstration of the hand robotic system on chronic stroke subjects and it will be presented in the conference.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a soft, inflatable manipulator that is antagonistically actuated by tendons and pneumatics. The combination of the two actuation mechanisms in this antagonistic robot structure is inspired by the octopus which uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles to steer, elongate, shrink and also stiffen its continuum arms. By {\&}{\#}x201C;activating{\&}{\#}x201D; its antagonistic muscle groups at the same time, the octopus can achieve multiple motion patterns as well as stiffen their arms. Being organized in a similar fashion, our robot manipulator uses, on the one hand, pneumatic actuation and, on the other hand, tendon-based actuation - one opposing the other, achieving an overall antagonistic actuation framework. Controlling the pressure inside the robot while at the same time controlling the tendons' displacements, the robot can be moved into a wide range of configurations while simultaneously controlling the arm's stiffness. This paper builds on earlier work by the authors: Here, we present a new conic-shaped manipulator structure and the control architecture. Using a constant curvature model, we have derived an approach suitable for controlling the robot manipulator. The manipulator's reachable workspace is analyzed and proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show the robot's stiffness control and motion abilities.},

abstract = {Many existing exoskeletons have followed a similar design concept that a rigid kinematic chain is actuated to mobilize a human wearer in spite of the intended applications. For performance-augmenting applications where an exoskeleton is usually paired with a specific wearer, the human-machine kinematic compatibility might be well maintained. However, in a clinical setting for rehabilitation where one exoskeleton is often shared by a group of patients, it will be difficult for the therapists to guarantee the on-site adjustments would accurately fit the exoskeleton to each individual patient with his/her unique anatomy. This paper proposes a continuum shoulder exoskeleton design to realize anatomy adaptive assistances (AAAs) for hemiparetic patients in a purely assistive mode where patient's limb motions are passive. The shoulder exoskeleton conforms to distinct human anatomies adaptively due to its intrinsic flexibility but still manages to deliver motion assistances in a consistent way. The design concept and the system descriptions are elaborated, including kinematics, statics, system construction, actuation, experimental validation, backbone shape identification, motion compensation, manikin trials, etc. The results suggest that it is possible to design a continuum exoskeleton to assist different patients with their limb movements, while no mechanical adjustments on the exoskeleton shall be performed. {\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

abstract = {Humanlike robot skills, e.g., cleaning a table or handing over a plate, can often be generalized to different task variations. Usually, these are start-/goal position, and trained environment changes. We investigate how to modify motion primitives to context changes, which are not included in the training data. Specifically, we focus on maintaining humanlike motion characteristics and generalizability, while adapting to unseen context. Therefore, we present an optimization tech- nique, which maximizes the expected return and minimizes the Kullback-Leibler Divergence to the demonstrations at the same time. Simultaneously, our algorithm learns how to linearly combine the adapted primitive with the demonstrations, such that only relevant parts of the primitive are adapted. We evaluate our approach in obstacle avoidance and broken joint scenarios in simulation, as well as on a real robot.},

abstract = {Relative positioning between multiple mobile users is essential for many applications, such as search and rescue in disaster areas or human social interaction. Inertial-measurement unit (IMU) is promising to determine the change of position over short periods of time, but it is very sensitive to error accumulation over long term run. By equipping the mobile users with ranging unit, e.g. ultra-wideband (UWB), it is possible to achieve accurate relative positioning by trilateration-based approaches. As compared to vision or laser-based sensors, the UWB does not need to be with in line-of-sight and provides accurate distance estimation. However, UWB does not provide any bearing information and the communication range is limited, thus UWB alone cannot determine the user location without any ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an approach to combine IMU inertial and UWB ranging measurement for relative positioning between multiple mobile users without the knowledge of the infrastructure. We incorporate the UWB and the IMU measurement into a probabilistic-based framework, which allows to cooperatively position a group of mobile users and recover from positioning failures. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating IMU inertial and UWB ranging measurements.},

abstract = {Soft actuators comprised of fluidic structures with fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures are seen throughout nature, exhibiting strength, power density, resilience, and diverse motions and forces.However, these structures are rarely used by engineers, in part due to the absence of a generalized understanding of their kinematics and forces. A small subset of soft actuators generating only extension or compression, popularly known as McKibben ac- tuators, has been thoroughly investigated. This paper introduces the entire design space of actuators built with two families of fibers, of whichMcKibben actuators occupy a subset. The helix angle of the actuator's translation and rotation deformation is determined from the kinematics of the fiber deformation for all fiber angles as the actuator is pressurized. The volumetric transduction of the ac- tuators, relating the output motion to change in contained volume, is analytically determined. The results are discretized to provide a designer with an easy to use design selection chart.The kinematics, force, and moment of the actuators are experimentally validated for all fiber angles.

abstract = {To understand the effects of soft exosuits on human loaded walking, we developed a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide synchronized forces to the ankle and hip joints. Two different assistive strategies were evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.25 m/s with a 23.8 kg backpack: 1) hip extension assistance and 2) multi-joint assistance (hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion). Results show that the exosuit introduces minimum changes to kinematics and reduces biological joint moments. A reduction trend in muscular activity was observed for both conditions. On average, the exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 0.21 ± 0.04 W/kg and 0.67 ± 0.09 W/kg for hip extension assistance and multi-joint assistance respectively, which is equivalent to an average metabolic reduction of 4.6{\%} and 14.6{\%} demonstrating that soft exosuits can effectively improve human walking efficiency during load carriage without affecting natural walking gait. Moreover, it indicates that actuating multiple joints with soft exosuits provides a significant benefit to muscular activity and metabolic cost compared to actuating single joint.},

The elasticity and strength range of this hydrogel can be customized according to application requirements by simple alterations in the recipe. Furthermore, we incorporated Agar/PAM hydrogel into our highly constrained soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) design and eventually produced SPAs with escalated capabilities, such as larger range of motion, higher force output, and power efficiency. Incorporating SPAs made of Agar/PAM hydrogel resulted in low viscosity, thermos-reversibility, and ultralow elasticity, which we believe can help to combine with the other functions of hydrogel, tailoring a better solution for ...},

abstract = {— Autonomous legged robots will be required to handle a wide range of tasks in complex environments. While a lot of research has focused on developing their abilities for periodic locomotion tasks, less effort has been invested in devising generalized strategies for dynamic, non-periodic movements. Motion design approaches are frequently enlisted in the form of teleoperation or predefined heuristics in such scenarios. We employ a realistic simulation of the hydraulically actuated HyQ2Max quadrupedal system for investigations on two distinctive tasks: rearing and posture recovery. We present a whole-body optimization methodology for non-periodic tasks on quadrupedal systems. This approach delivers solutions involving multiple contacts without the need for predefined feet placements. The results obtained show the potential of optimization approaches for motion synthesis in the context of complex tasks.},

We present a novel synergy-based approach for operator interfaces, by introducing a series of octopus-arm inspired grasp-synergies. These grasp-synergies automatically coordinate the degrees of freedom of the continuum manipulator, allowing an operator to perform kinematically complex grasping motions through simple and intuitive joystick inputs. This effectively reduces the complexity of operation and allows the operator to devote more of his attention to higher-level concerns (e.g. goal, environment). We demonstrate the grasp-synergies interface design in both simulation and hardware using the nine degree of freedom Octarm continuum manipulator.},

This system was developed as an alternative to today's commonly used electromechanical prosthetic actuation systems. System components and hand prototypes reflect many years of experience of our laboratory in rehabilitation medicine, CAD design and prototyping, mechanical engineering, electronic construction, and programming. Prototypes of hydraulically actuated hands were tested by patients under support of orthopaedic companies. The latest hydraulic prostheses have advantages in construction, design, and performance, including adaptivity during grasping and holding of objects. The newly developed miniaturised hydraulic system is competitive with standard mechanical systems of electrically driven prosthetic hands. The modular construction of the system developed allows for customising the mechanical construction of each prosthetic hand and its functional abilities. Contributions of patients concerning grasping activities of prostheses may be taken into account when choosing the hand components already. The components of the new hydraulic actuation system and their technical characteristics will be interesting for specialists in automation technology, actuator development, mechanics, prosthetics, and rehabilitation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Our method evaluates the proper exposure time by maximizing a robust gradient-based image quality metric. The optimization is achieved by exploiting the photometric response function of the camera. Our exposure control method is evaluated in different real world environments and outperforms the built-in auto-exposure function of the cam-era. To validate the benefit of our approach, we adapt a state-of-the-art visual odometry pipeline (SVO) to work with varying exposure time and demonstrate improved performance using our exposure control method in challenging HDR environments.},

The proposed procedure exploits a transformation matrix (describing the relative position between the local tactile elements and the global force/torque measurements) to define a linear regression problem on the unknown local stiffness. Experiments have been conducted on the foot of the iCub robot, sensorized with a single force/torque sensor and a tactile array of 250 tactile elements (taxels) on the foot sole. Results show that a simple calibration procedure can be employed to estimate the stiffness parameters of virtual springs over a tactile array and to use these model to predict normal forces exerted on the array based only on the tactile feedback. Leveraging on previous works [1] the proposed procedure does not necessarily need a-priori information on the transformation matrix of the taxels which can be directly estimated from available measurements.},

Robot assisted gait training (RAGT) was devel- oped for stroke survivors using active leg exoskeleton (ALEX) and a force-field controller, which uses assist-as-needed paradigm for rehabilitation. In this paradigm undesirable gait motion is resisted and assistance is provided towards desired motion. The force-field controller achieves this paradigm by effectively applying forces at the ankle of the subject through actuators on the hip and knee joints. Two stroke survivors participated in a 15-session gait training study each with ALEX. The results show that by the end of the training the gait pattern of the patients improved and became closer to a healthy subject's gait pattern. Improvement is seen as an increase in the size of the patients' gait pattern, increased knee and ankle joint excursions and increase in their walking speeds on the treadmill.},

abstract = {Traditionally, robot manipulators have been a simple arrangement of a small number of serially connected links and actuated joints. Though these manipulators prove to be very effective for many tasks, they are not without their limitations, due mainly to their lack of maneuverability or total degrees of freedom. Continuum style (i.e., continuous "back-bone") robots, on the other hand, exhibit a wide range of maneuverability, and can have a large number of degrees of freedom. The motion of continuum style robots is generated through the bending of the robot over a given section; unlike traditional robots where the motion occurs in discrete locations, i.e., joints. The motion of continuum manipulators is often compared to that of biological manipulators such as trunks and tentacles. These continuum style robots can achieve motions that could only be obtainable by a conventionally designed robot with many more degrees of freedom. In this paper we present a detailed formulation and explanation of a novel kinematic model for continuum style robots. The design, construction, and implementation of our continuum style robot called the elephant trunk manipulator is presented. Experimental results are then provided to verify the legitimacy of our model when applied to our physical manipulator. We also provide a set of obstacle avoidance experiments that help to exhibit the practical implementation of both our manipulator and our kinematic model. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This work investigates the influence of time delay on the theoretical optimal performance during haptic rendering with regard to minimal settling time, which belongs to the most frequently used design criteria in control engineering. It is shown that both continuous-time stiffness and damping of human operator or haptic device improve the optimal performance of the device. For the worst case, i.e., without such physical elements, the influence of delay on the optimal settling time becomes almost linear. This observation leads to an easy-to-remember rule of thumb for the optimal settling time that a haptic device should theoretically be able to reach. It states that each sampling period of additional time delay causes the optimal settling time (for a 2{\%} position threshold) to increase by approximately five sampling periods. In this linear relation, the effect of discrete-time sampling appears to correspond to a delay of one whole sampling period. The theoretical investigations are accompanied by a series of experiments on a DLR/KUKA light-weight robot, which shows that the newly introduced rule of thumb also applies for single joints of complex robotic systems.},

To foster research in this domain, Amazon holds picking challenges. We present our system which achieved second and third place in the Amazon Picking Challenge 2016 tasks. The challenge required participants to pick a list of items from a shelf or to stow items into the shelf. Using two deep-learning approaches for object detection and semantic segmentation and one item model registration method, our system localizes the requested item. Manipulation occurs using suction on points determined heuristically or from 6D item model registration. Parametrized motion primitives are chained to generate motions. We present a full-system evaluation during the APC 2016 and component-level evaluations of the perception system on an annotated dataset.},

The system is comprised of a robot arm from a Rethink Robotics Baxter robot mounted to an assistive mobility device, a control system for that arm, and a user interface with a variety of access methods for selecting desired objects. The system uses grasp detection to allow previously unseen objects to be picked up by the system. The grasp detection algorithms also allow for objects to be grasped in cluttered environments. We evaluate our system in a number of experiments on a large variety of objects.

FSRs from different manufacturers, with variation in morphologies and loading capacities were selected in past research projects. However a functional comparison of different FSRs and options on how to choose them for gait analysis is not established yet. In this work, investigation and comparison of behavioral patterns in measuring normal gait from two major FSR sensors are done. These FSRs had been utilised previously for the purpose of gait sensing. They were placed underneath the heel alternatively to detect heel pressures while wearing footwear with laces and with another footwear possessing straps for harnessing. Both sensors are connected to a miniature low power wireless senor node used for data collection and wireless transmission for off-line analysis of pressure patterns. The results give good indications on capabilities and trade-offs when using the two sensors types.},

Remarkable resilience, shape memory effect, high energy density, and scalability are attributed to nickel titanium (NiTi) making it an excellent actuator candidate for meso-scale applications.

An enhanced spring NiTi model describes the combination of martensite deformation and spring effect due to its geometry. This paper also describes a manufacturing process and characterization for micro-scale NiTi coil actuators in various annealing temperatures. The presented fiber is 400¿m in diameter and 0.5m in length exhibiting 50{\%} contraction and 1226J/kg of energy density with 40g of force. By changing the geometry of the spring, force-displacement characteristics can be tuned. An enhanced-performance inverted-spring manufacturing method is also described and characterized. A method of discrete displacement control is presented. Taking advantage of the flexibility of micro-coil spring, we present a novel mesh-worm prototype that utilizes bio-inspired antagonistic actuation for its body deformation and locomotion.},

abstract = {Rotary blood pumps which have contact-less suspension are small, durable and widely used for left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). In order to design a total artificial heart (TAH) with rotary blood pumps, two pumps one for each ventricle, are controlled independently. Some of the challenges for the development of a TAH includes the requirement of a small size and the anatomical fitting of inlets and outlets which should be arranged closely on the circumference in the same direction. And they should be combined into a unit. In this paper, a helical flow total artificial heart (HFTAH) combing two centrifugal pumps with helical inlet in face is proposed in order to achieve a smaller TAH. To examine the pump performance, a preliminary test model for left ventricle was built, the size of the pump was 69.0mm in diameter and 45.0mm height. The size of the impeller was 44.0mm in diameter and 23.0mm height including a 15.0mm-height hydrodynamic bearing. The pump was externally driven by a direct current motor. 5.0L/min flow rate against 100mmHg pressure difference was obtained, where the total power consumption was 5.0W, the system efficiency was 23{\%} with a rotational speed of 2070rpm. In this system, maximum pressure head, flow rate and efficiency were 420mmHg, 15.0L/min and 26{\%}, respectively. In acute animal experiments with three healthy adult goats, the total biventricular bypass assist system using the pumps was able to maintain the maximum aortic flow at approximately 5.0L/min, and the pulmonary arterial flow at approximately 4.6L/min, the mean aorta pressure was 105mmHg, and the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 51mmHg. The development of the control method is undergoing, and a driving system and the pump aiming at the chronic animal experiments will be developed.},

Several leg exoskeletons have been developed by various groups in an attempt to augment the load carrying capability of the human. Previous research efforts have not fully exploited the passive dynamics of walking and have largely focused on fully actuated exoskeletons that are heavy with large energy requirements. In this paper, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton design is presented that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload. Two exoskeleton architectures are pursued based on examining human walking data. A first architecture consists of springs at the hip, a variable impedance device at the knee, and springs at the ankle. A second architecture replaces the springs at the hip with a non-conservative actuator to examine the effect of adding power at desired instances throughout the gait cycle. Preliminary studies show that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle},

The actuator consists of several (three, four, or five) chambers (arranged around the circumference of a circle surrounding a central rod) that can be actuated independently using negative pressure (or partial vacuum). Sequential actuation of the four-chamber device using reduced pressure moves the central rod cyclically in an approximately square path. We characterize the trajectory of the actuator and the force exerted by it, as we vary the material used for fabrication, the number of chambers, and the size of the actuator. We demonstrate two applications of this actuator: to deliver fluid while stirring (by replacing the central rod with a needle) and for locomotion that mimics a reptilian gait (by combining four actuators together).},

We propose a novel approach in which the grasping problem is solved by modeling the object and the volume graspable by the hand with superquadric functions. The object model is computed in real-time using stereo vision. Pose computation is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem, which is solved in real-time using the Ipopt software package. Notably, our method finds solutions in which the fingers are located on portions of the object that are occluded by vision. The performance of our approach has been assessed on a real robotic system, the iCub humanoid robot. The experiments show that the proposed method computes proper poses, suitable for grasping even small objects, while avoiding hitting the table with the fingers.},

abstract = {The State of Texas has issued water rights permits for Lakes Buchanan and Travis that allow the Lower Colorado River Authority to make water available to both firm and interruptible customers. Firm customers can be supplied in an amount up to the firm yield. Interruptible water may be available when firm demands are less than the firm yield, but interruptible supplies are cut off under drought conditions. The drought of record in this region of Texas occurred from 1947 to 1952, during a period of low inflow from 1946 through 1957. As a safeguard for firm customer supplies, the state permit requires that LCRA establish criteria to monitor for a drought worse than the drought of record and declare that a current drought is worse than the drought of record if conditions warrant. If a drought worse than the drought of record is declared, measures are taken to extend firm supplies. In this study, LCRA's current method for monitoring and declaring a drought worse than the drought of record and candidate replacement methods were evaluated. The study found that in addition to being difficult to communicate, the current method could overlook a moderate drought of extended duration. The study investigated Precipitation Indicators, Drought Indices, and regionally focused methods. Candidate methods were the Reservoir Deficit Index Method, a Revised LCRA Method and the Cumulative Runoff Deficit Method. Each of these would be an appropriate measure of drought intensity and would provide a legitimate determination of a drought worse than the drought of record. However, each has benefits and shortcomings that must be weighed against ease of communication and computation},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test if functional electrical stimulation (FES) can enhance the recovery of upper extremity function during early stroke rehabilitation. METHODS: Open-label block-randomized trial, begun during inpatient rehabilitation and continued at the patients' home. Patients were assigned to either FES combined with task-specific upper extremity rehabilitation (n = 7) or a control group that received task-specific therapy alone (n = 8) over 12 weeks. Outcome measures . Hand function (Box {\&} Blocks, B {\&} B; Jebsen-Taylor light object lift, J-T) and motor control (modified Fugl-Meyer, mF-M) were video-recorded for both upper extremities at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: B{\&}B mean score at 12 weeks favored (P = .049) the FES group (42.3 +/- 16.6 blocks) over the control group (26.3 +/- 11.0 blocks). The FES group J-T task was 6.7 +/- 2.9 seconds and faster (P = .049) than the 11.8 +/- 5.4 seconds of the control group. Mean mF-M score of the FES group at 12 weeks was 49.3 +/- 5.1 points out of 54, compared to the control group that scored 40.6 +/- 8.2 points (P = .042). All patients regained hand function. CONCLUSION: Upper extremity task-oriented training that begins soon after stroke that incorporates FES may improve upper extremity functional use in patients with mild/moderate paresis more than task-oriented training without FES.},

abstract = {Surgical manipulators are increasingly capable of approaching deep seated pathologies through convoluted pathways due to advances in the field of continuum robotics. This class of robots can be, in most cases, accurately modelled as a chain of cylindrical shapes. In order to safely and seamlessly telemanipulate these robots, which have complex non-intuitive kinematics, haptic guidance schemes have been developed that rely on accurate proximity queries (PQ) to calculate the distance between the continuum robot and the anatomy. This paper introduces an approach to accurately model continuum robots using cylindrical shaped segments with spherical or flat caps and then efficiently calculate the shortest distance to a triangle mesh. Implementations of efficient, analytical narrow phase PQ calculations for simple and complex geometrical primitives suitable for parallel computing hardware are presented together with experimental validation which show improved performance suitable for real-time robotic applications. An in silico experiment comparing various root-finding algorithms, which are commonly used in PQ calculation or other optimization tasks are compared to assess their suitability when executed on different hardware. The implications of these experimental results are discussed, in particular with regards to the selection of a suitable proximity query algorithm depending on the available parallel computing hardware. Finally, an outlook of future improvements for dense dynamic anatomies is presented.},

In our novel design we have proposed: 1) a modular continuum arm with independent actuation units for each module, to increase maintainability; 2) a soft reconfigurable hand, for a better adaptation of the fingers to objects of different shapes and size; 3) a moving base for increasing the workspace. We used a hybrid approach in designing and manufacturing by integrating soft and hard components, in both materials and actuation, providing high lateral stiffness in the arm through flat springs, soft joints in fingers for more compliancy and tendon-motor actuation mechanism providing flexibility but at the same time precision and speed. The SIMBA manipulator has demonstrated excellent grasping and manipulation capabilities by being able to grasp objects with different fragility, geometry and size; and by lifting objects with up to 2Kg of weight it demonstrate also to be robust and reliable. The experimental results pointed out that our design and approach can lead to the realization of robots able to act in unknown and unstructured environments in synergy with humans, for a variety of applications where compliancy is fundamental, preserving robustness and safety.},

While Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo algorithms can finely reconstruct the 3D structure of a field with low-cost image sensors, these algorithms fail to capture the dynamic nature of continuously growing crops. In this paper we propose a 4D reconstruction approach to crop monitoring, which employs a spatio-temporal model of dynamic scenes that is useful for precision agriculture applications. Additionally, we provide a robust data association algorithm to address the problem of large appearance changes due to scenes being viewed from different angles at different points in time, which is critical to achieving 4D reconstruction. Finally, we collected a high quality dataset with ground truth statistics to evaluate the performance of our method. We demonstrate that our 4D reconstruction approach provides models that are qualitatively correct with respect to visual appearance and quantitatively accurate when measured against the ground truth geometric properties of the monitored crops.},

abstract = {Rigid actuators that accompany traditional robotic systems allow them to perform tasks with unmatched precision and efficiency. However, such systems are inapt when flexibility and suppleness are required. Inversely, soft robotic actuators are constructed out of naturally compliant materials. This compliance allows them to execute complex motions while their inherent lack of hardness removes the dangers that commonly accompany traditional robots. One archetype of the soft robot is the pneumatic bending actuator. The actuators convert the flow of pressurized air into bending outputs; however, most bending actuators are only limited to one bending trajectory. A new bending actuator, capable of active reconfiguration, is realized through the combination of a non-inflating, flexible, plastic spine and multiple, inflatable, fabric modules. The spine acts as the primary conduit and is responsible for distributing the pressurized flow to the modules. Modules can be removed and replaced seamlessly. The combination of varying module geometries can produce a heterogenic bending trajectory. Blockages located along the spine can separate flow, allowing more customization of the trajectory. A physical model predicting the pressure-bending relationship was conceptualized and verified. When pressurized to 100kPa, the 5-module and 10-module actuators achieved bending angles of 48.76o and 137.65o respectively. The actuators behave as a first-order system when supplied with a step input},

abstract = {This paper presents a characterization study of the Hokuyo URG-04LX scanning laser rangefinder (LRF). The Hokuyo LRF is similar in function to the Sick LRF, which has been the de-facto standard range sensor for mobile robot obstacle avoidance and mapping applications for the last decade. Problems with the Sick LRF are its relatively large size, weight, and power consumption, allowing its use only on relatively large mobile robots. The Hokuyo LRF is substantially smaller, lighter, and consumes less power, and is therefore more suitable for small mobile robots. The question is whether it performs just as well as the Sick LRF in typical mobile robot applications. In 2002, two of the authors of the present paper published a characterization study of the Sick LRF. For the present paper we used the exact same test apparatus and test procedures as we did in the 2002 paper, but this time to characterize the Hokuyo LRF. As a result, we are in the unique position of being able to provide not only a detailed characterization study of the Hokuyo LRF, but also to compare the Hokuyo LRF with the Sick LRF under identical test conditions. Among the tested characteristics are sensitivity to a variety of target surface properties and incidence angles, which may potentially affect the sensing performance. We also discuss the performance of the Hokuyo LRF with regard to the mixed pixels problem associated with LRFs. Lastly, the present paper provides a calibration model for improving the accuracy of the Hokuyo LRF.},

Laser scanners are lighting invariant, provide accurate range data, and typically cover a large field of view, making them interesting sensors for robotics applications. So far, research on detection in laser range data has been dominated by hand-crafted features and boosted classifiers, potentially losing performance due to suboptimal design choices. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based detector for this task. We show how to effectively apply CNNs for detection in 2D range data, and propose a depth preprocessing step and voting scheme that significantly improve CNN performance. We demonstrate our approach on wheelchairs and walkers, obtaining state of the art detection results. Apart from the training data, none of our design choices limits the detector to these two classes, though. We provide a ROS node for our detector and release our dataset containing 464k laser scans, out of which 24k were annotated.},

abstract = {Soft, inflatable segments are the active elements responsible for the actuation of soft machines and robots. Although current designs of fluidic actuators achieve motion with large amplitudes, they require large amounts of supplied volume, limiting their speed and compactness. To circumvent these limitations, here we embrace instabilities and show that they can be exploited to amplify the response of the system. By combining experimental and numerical tools we design and construct fluidic actuators in which snap-through instabilities are harnessed to generate large motion, high forces, and fast actuation at constant volume. Our study opens avenues for the design of the next generation of soft actuators and robots in which small amounts of volume are sufficient to achieve significant ranges of motion.},

abstract = {In medical and biotechnology fields, soft devices are required because of their high safety from low mechanical impedance. FMA (Flexible Microactuator) is one of the typical soft actuators. It consists of fiber-reinforced rubber structure with multi air chambers and realizes bending motion pneumatically. It has been applied to robot hands, robot legs and so on. High potential of FMA has been confirmed by many experiments reported in several papers. However in fabrication process of the actuator, it is difficult to embed the reinforced fiber in the rubber structure. In this study, we aim at development of a fiber less FMA realizing quite large motion, which can be said curling motion, and a soft hand using the actuators. We design the actuator without fiber using nonlinear FEM (Finite Element Method) and derived efficient shape. The actuator is fabricated through micro rubber casting process including micro machining process for molds, micro vacuum rubber molding process and rubber bonding process with surface improvement by excimer light. Basic driving experiments of the actuator showed that it realized curling motion which agreed well with FEM results. And the actuator could grasp a fish egg without breaking. Additionally, we made a soft hand consisting of three curling actuators. This hand also could be manufactured by simple casting process. The developed hand works opening and closing motions well.},

Starting from the observation of the performances of the octopus and drawing inspiration by its functional anatomy, several mock-ups, made by different materials and actuated by different cable arrangements have been tested. For this purpose a versatile platform has been designed and built, where the various solutions have been mounted and compared. The final aim of the work is to replicate the main complex movements of the octopus in a robotic platform. In particular the reaching movement, which best represents the stereotyped motion pattern of the octopus arm, has been reproduced.},

abstract = {An exoskeleton is an external structural mechanism with joints and links corresponding to those of the human body. With applications in rehabilitation medicine and virtual reality simulation, exoskeletons offer benefits for both disabled and healthy populations. A pilot database defining the kinematics and dynamics of the upper limb during daily living activities was one among several factors guiding the development of an anthropomorphic, 7-DOF, powered arm exoskeleton. Additional design inputs include anatomical and physiological considerations, workspace analyses, and upper limb joint ranges of motion. The database was compiled from 19 arm activities of daily living. The cable-actuated dexterous exoskeleton for neurorehabilitation (CADEN)-7 offers remarkable opportunities as a versatile human-machine interface and as a new generation of assistive technology. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of cable-pulley reductions were incorporated into the design, leading to low inertia, high-stiffness links, and backdrivable transmissions with zero backlash. The design enables full glenohumeral, elbow, and wrist joint functionality. Potential applications of the exoskeleton as a wearable robot include: 1) a therapeutic and diagnostics device for physiotherapy, 2) an assistive (orthotic) device for human power amplifications, 3) a haptic device in virtual reality simulation, and 4) a master device for teleoperation.},

The deterministic pol- icy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value func- tion. This simple form means that the deter- ministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic pol- icy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counter- parts in high-dimensional action spaces.},

This requires a non-trivial extension of previously proposed kinematic models, and poses challenges for real-time control of the robot. We introduce a tangling/untangling algorithm to map between overall cable lengths and per-section cable lengths. Details of the design and its implementation are presented, along with a summary of real-time control issues and experimental results.},

We evaluate the performance of our controller by testing it on the LittleDog quadruped robot, over a wide variety of rough terrain of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate the generalization ability of this controller by presenting test results from an independent external test team on terrains that have never been shown to us.},

abstract = {Recently, end-to-end learning frameworks are gaining prevalence in the field of robot control. These frameworks input states/images and directly predict the torques or the action parameters. However, these approaches are often critiqued due to their huge data requirements for learning a task. The argument of the difficulty in scalability to multiple tasks is well founded, since training these tasks often require hundreds or thousands of examples. But do end-to-end approaches need to learn a unique model for every task? Intuitively, it seems that sharing across tasks should help since all tasks require some common understanding of the environment. In this paper, we attempt to take the next step in data-driven end-to-end learning frameworks: move from the realm of task-specific models to joint learning of multiple robot tasks. In an astonishing result we show that models with multi-task learning tend to perform better than task-specific models trained with same amounts of data. For example, a deep-network learned with 2.5K grasp and 2.5K push examples performs better on grasping than a network trained on 5K grasp examples.},

This significant and disabling condition can result in paralysis that must be treated by regular sessions with a dedicated physical therapist in order to regain motor function. However, the use of therapists is expensive, in high demand, and requires patient travel to a rehabilitation clinic. We propose an inexpensive and wearable upper body orthotics system that can be used at home to provide the same level of rehabilitation as the current physical therapy standard of care. The system is composed of a soft orthotic device with an integrated cable actuation system that is worn over the upper body, a limb position sensing system, and an actuator package. This paper presents initial design considerations and the evaluation of a proof of concept system for shoulder joint rehabilitation. Through simulations and experimental evaluation, the system is shown to be adjustable, easily wearable, and adaptable to misalignment and anatomical variations. Insights provided by these initial studies will inform the development of a complete upper body orthotic system.},

abstract = {This paper reports the rationale and design of a robotic arm, as inspired by an octopus arm. The octopus arm shows peculiar features, such as the ability to bend in all directions, to produce fast elongations, and to vary its stiffness. The octopus achieves these unique motor skills, thanks to its peculiar muscular structure, named muscular hydrostat. Different muscles arranged on orthogonal planes generate an antagonistic action on each other in the muscular hydrostat, which does not change its volume during muscle contractions, and allow bending and elongation of the arm and stiffness variation. By drawing inspiration from natural skills of octopus, and by analysing the geometry and mechanics of the muscular structure of its arm, we propose the design of a robot arm consisting of an artificial muscular hydrostat structure, which is completely soft and compliant, but also able to stiffen. In this paper, we discuss the design criteria of the robotic arm and how this design and the special arrangement of its muscular structure may bring the building of a robotic arm into being, by showing the results obtained by mathematical models and prototypical mock-ups.},

abstract = {The amplitude response of infrared (IR) sensors based on reflected amplitude of the surrounding objects is non-linear and depends on the reflectance characteristics of the object surface. As a result, the main use of IR sensors in robotics is for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, their inherently fast response is very attractive for enhancing the real-time operation of a mobile robot in, for instance, map building tasks. Thus, it seems that the development of new low-cost IR sensors able to accurately measure distances with reduced response times is worth researching. In this paper, a new IR sensor based on the light intensity back-scattered from objects and able to measure distances of up to 1 m is described. Also, the sensor model is described and the expected errors in distance estimates are analysed and modelled. Finally, the experimental results obtained are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The small scale of minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant challenges to developing robust, smart, and dexterous tools for manipulating millimeter and sub-millimeter anatomical structures (vessels, nerves) and surgical equipment (sutures, staples). Robotic MIS systems offer the potential to transform this medical field by enabling precise repair of these miniature tissue structures through the use of teleoperation and haptic feedback. However, this effort is currently limited by the inability to make robust and accurate MIS end effectors with integrated force and contact sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the novel Pop-Up Book MEMS manufacturing method to fabricate the mechanical and sensing elements of an instrumented MIS grasper. A custom thin-foil strain gage was manufactured in parallel with the mechanical components of the grasper to realize a fully-integrated electromechanical system in a single manufacturing step, removing the need for manual assembly, bonding and alignment. In preliminary experiments, the integrated grasper is capable of resolving forces as low as 30 mN, with a sensitivity of approximately 408 mV/N. This level of performance will enable robotic surgical systems that can handle delicate tissue structures and perform dexterous procedures through the use of haptic feedback guidance.},

Biomim. 7 025005 Abstract Soft robotics is a current focus in robotics research because of the expected capability of soft robots to better interact with real-world environments. As a point of inspiration in the development of innovative technologies in soft robotics, octopuses are particularly interesting 'animal models'. Octopus arms have unique biomechanical capabilities that combine significant pliability with the ability to exert a great deal of force, because they lack rigid structures but can change and control their degree of stiffness. The octopus arm motor capability is a result of the peculiar arrangement of its muscles and the properties of its tissues. These special abilities have been investigated by the authors in a specific study dedicated to identifying the key principles underlying these biological functions and deriving engineering requirements for robotics solutions. This paper, which is the second in a two-part series, presents how the identified requirements can be used to create innovative technological solutions, such as soft materials, mechanisms and actuators. Experiments indicate the ability of these proposed solutions to ensure the same performance as in the biological model in terms of compliance, elongation and force. These results represent useful and relevant components of innovative soft-robotic systems and suggest their potential use to create a new generation of highly dexterous, soft-bodied robots.

abstract = {In this paper we document the activity of key muscles of the tongue, hyobranchial apparatus and head during prey capture in the lizard Chamaeleo jacksonii Boulenger and use these data to test current hypotheses of chameleon tongue function. Electromyographic recordings were made during 27 feedings from nine individuals and synchronized with high-speed video recordings (200 fields s-1), permitting an assessment of the activity of muscles relative to the onset of tongue projection. contact between tongue and prey, and tongue retraction. Four major results were obtained. (1) The hyoglossi muscles exhibit a single burst of activity that begins between 10 ms before and 20 ms after the onset of tongue projection and continues throughout the period of tongue retraction. (2) The accelerator muscle exhibits a biphasic activity pattern, with the first burst lasting about 185 ms and ending an average of 10.6 ms prior to the onset of projection. (3) The accelerator muscle shows regional variation in morphology that corresponds with variation in motor pattern. The anterior region of the muscle, unlike the posterior portion, exhibits only a single burst of activity that begins 2.5 ms after the onset of tongue projection and is thus not involved in launching the tongue. (4) The geniohyoidei, sternohyoidei, sternothyroidei, depressor mandibulae, adductor mandibulae and pterygoideus all exhibit activity patterns consistent with previously reported kinematic patterns and their proposed roles. The major implications of these results for models of the chameleon feeding mechanism are (1) that the hyoglossi do not act to hold the tongue on the entoglossal process during a loading period prior to tongue projection, and (2) that the presence of 185 ms of intense activity in the accelerator muscle prior to tongue projection suggests the presence of a preloading mechanism, the nature of which is the subject of the companion paper.},

The idea is to benefit from the advantages of both kinds of platforms, i.e., physical strength versus large workspace. The dynamic model of such robotic systems is derived, and its characteristic structure exhibited. Based on the dynamical structure of the system a nonlinear control scheme, augmented with a disturbance observer is proposed to perform trajectory tracking tasks in presence of model inaccuracies and external disturbances. The system redundancy is exploited by solving an optimal force/torque allocation problem that takes into account the heterogeneous system constraints and maximizes the force manipulability ellipsoid. Simulation results validated the proposed control scheme for this novel heterogeneous robotic system. We finally present a prototypical mechanical design and preliminary experimental evaluation of a MAGMaS composed by a kuka LWR4 and quadrotor based aerial robot.},

Specifically, we consider online receding horizon based planners that need to operate in a latent environment where the latent information can be modeled via Gaussian Processes. Online path planning in latent environments is challenging since the robot needs to explore the environment to get a more accurate model of latent information for better planning later and also achieves the task as quick as possible. We propose UCB style algorithms that are popular in the bandit settings and show how those analyses can be adapted to the online robotic path planning problems. The proposed algorithm trades-off exploration and exploitation in near-optimal manner and has appealing no-regret properties. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework on the application of aircraft flight path planning when the winds are partially observed.},

abstract = {The supercoiled polymer (SCP) actuator is a re- cently discovered artificial muscle that demonstrates significant mechanical power, large contraction, and good dynamic range in a muscle-like form factor. There has been a rapid increase of research efforts devoted to the study of SCP actuators. For robotics, SCP actuators overcome specific challenges of artificial muscles such as shape memory alloy wires, where limited strain and slow dynamics, and power consumption had limited their use. It is known that hysteresis nonlinearity results from coiling the threads, and can cause up to 30{\%} strain difference under the same voltage; however, no work has been reported to characterize the hysteresis in SCP actuators. In this paper, three new models are formulated to characterize the hysteretic relationship between three coupled variables (voltage input, strain, and load) of an SCP actuator, namely, the augmented generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii model, the augmented Preisach model, and the augmented linear model. By incorporating the relationship between hysteresis curves and loading forces, the proposed models can efficiently characterize the hysteresis. Open-loop position control is further realized through inverse compensation. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes can effectively estimate and compensate the hysteresis. For the first time, the hysteresis characterization and compensation of SCPactuators are successfully demonstrated, such that accurate robot control can be realized.},

abstract = {Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a method that provides rigorous analyses of the safety properties of dynamical systems. This method has been successfully applied to many low-dimensional dynamical system models such as coarse models of aircraft and quadrotors in order to provide safety guarantees in potentially dangerous scenarios. These guarantees can be provided by the computation of a backward reachable set (BRS), which represents the set of states from which the system may be driven into violating safety properties despite the system's best effort to remain safe. Unfortunately, HJ reachability is not practical for high-dimensional systems because the complexity of the BRS computation scales exponentially with the number of state dimensions. Although numerous approximation techniques are able to tractably provide conservative estimates of the BRS, they often require restrictive assumptions about system dynamics without providing an exact solution. In this paper we propose a general method for decomposing dynamical systems. Even when the resulting subsystems are coupled, relatively high-dimensional BRSs that were previously intractable or expensive to compute can now be quickly and exactly computed in lower-dimensional subspaces. As a result, the curse of dimensionality is alleviated to a large degree without sacrificing optimality. We demonstrate our theoretical results through two numerical examples: a 3D Dubins Car model and a 6D Acrobatic Quadrotor model.},

abstract = {The very first application of active exoskeleton robot was to provide external power to a soldier so that he can carry additional weight than his strength. Since then this technology has focused on developing systems for assisting and augmenting human power. Later this technology is expanded into other applications such as limb rehabilitation and tele-operations. Exoskeleton research is still a growing area and demands multi-disciplinary approaches in solving complex technical issues. In this paper, the developments of active upper-limb exoskeleton robots are reviewed. This paper presents the major developments occurred in the history, the key milestones during the evolution and major research challenges in the present day context of hardware systems of upper-limb exoskeleton robots. Moreover, the paper provides a classification, a comparison and a design overview of mechanisms, actuation and power transmission of most of the upper-limb exoskeleton robots that have been found in the literature. A brief review on the control methods of upper-limb exoskeleton robots is also presented. At the end, a discussion on the future directions of the upper-limb exoskeleton robots was included.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The allocation of scarce health care resources requires a knowledge of disease costs. Whereas many studies of a variety of diseases are available, few focus on job-related injuries and illnesses. This article provides estimates of the national costs of occupational injury and illness among civilians in the United States for 2007.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This study provides estimates of both the incidence of fatal and nonfatal injuries and nonfatal illnesses and the prevalence of fatal diseases as well as both medical and indirect (productivity) costs. To generate the estimates, I combined primary and secondary data sources with parameters from the literature and model assumptions. My primary sources were injury, disease, employment, and inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as costs data from the National Council on Compensation Insurance and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. My secondary sources were the National Academy of Social Insurance, literature estimates of Attributable Fractions (AF) of diseases with occupational components, and national estimates for all health care costs. Critical model assumptions were applied to the underreporting of injuries, wage-replacement rates, and AFs. Total costs were calculated by multiplying the number of cases by the average cost per case. A sensitivity analysis tested for the effects of the most consequential assumptions. Numerous improvements over earlier studies included reliance on BLS data for government workers and ten specific cancer sites rather than only one broad cancer category.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: The number of fatal and nonfatal injuries in 2007 was estimated to be more than 5,600 and almost 8,559,000, respectively, at a cost of {\$}6 billion and {\$}186 billion. The number of fatal and nonfatal illnesses was estimated at more than 53,000 and nearly 427,000, respectively, with cost estimates of {\$}46 billion and {\$}12 billion. For injuries and diseases combined, medical cost estimates were {\$}67 billion (27{\%} of the total), and indirect costs were almost {\$}183 billion (73{\%}). Injuries comprised 77 percent of the total, and diseases accounted for 23 percent. The total estimated costs were approximately {\$}250 billion, compared with the inflation-adjusted cost of {\$}217 billion for 1992.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The medical and indirect costs of occupational injuries and illnesses are sizable, at least as large as the cost of cancer. Workers' compensation covers less than 25 percent of these costs, so all members of society share the burden. The contributions of job-related injuries and illnesses to the overall cost of medical care and ill health are greater than generally assumed.},

Towards this goal, we utilize freely available cartographic maps and derive a probabilistic model that exploits semantic cues in the form of sun direction, presence of an intersection, road type, speed limit as well as the ego-car trajectory in order to produce very reliable localization results. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach can localize much faster (in terms of driving time) with less computation and more robustly than competing approaches, which ignore semantic information.},

The first application is a task of localization and grasping of objects, using our previous work on compliant tactile exploration. We successfully localize and grasp objects whose position is unknown, using touch in a simulated environment.

abstract = {Soft robots are able to complete tasks which traditional robots cannot, thus providing new opportunities for robots to navigate confined spaces. These tasks include pipe inspection and endoluminal surgical applications. The research objective of this work is to present a design methodology for soft robots capable of traversing a cannula or pipe using only passive elements, a single pressure source, and while avoiding blockage, that is, avoiding full occlusion of the cannula to still allow fluid flow. The robot consists of three segments, each with actuators and valves, and is driven by hydraulics (water). The actuators were built using the FREE method and optimized for the specific task of traversing a cannula with a diameter of 19mm. An experimental approach was used to create a pressure-volume relationship from the kinematic fiberreinforced elastomer enclosure (FREE) model. The passive valves were built as flow restrictors and modeled with the nonlinear orifice equation. A simulation and grid search was performed over a range of valve coefficients. An objective function was then maximized to produce orifice coefficients which augmented extension of the robot per input pressure cycle. The physical robot was then constructed and tested in a cannula. This resulted in a robot which was serially actuated, never fully occluded the cannula, and was able to successfully locomote a cannula at a rate of 274mm per two second cycle. This experimental result was close to the simulated result of 28mm per cycle.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many soldiers are expected to carry heavy loads over extended distances, often resulting in physical and mental fatigue. In this study, the design and testing of an autonomous leg exoskeleton is presented. The aim of the device is to reduce the energetic cost of loaded walking. In addition, we present the Augmentation Factor, a general framework of exoskeletal performance that unifies our results with the varying abilities of previously developed exoskeletons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed an autonomous battery powered exoskeleton that is capable of providing substantial levels of positive mechanical power to the ankle during the push-off region of stance phase. We measured the metabolic energy consumption of seven subjects walking on a level treadmill at 1.5 m/s, while wearing a 23 kg vest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the push-off portion of the stance phase, the exoskeleton applied positive mechanical power with an average across the gait cycle equal to 23 ± 2 W (11.5 W per ankle). Use of the autonomous leg exoskeleton significantly reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 36 ± 12 W, which was an improvement of 8 ± 3{\%} (p = 0.025) relative to the control condition of not wearing the exoskeleton.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In the design of leg exoskeletons, the results of this study highlight the importance of minimizing exoskeletal power dissipation and added limb mass, while providing substantial positive power during the walking gait cycle.},

An important requirement to enable self-contained soft mobile robots is an on-board power source. In this paper, we present an approach to create a bio-inspired soft robotic snake that can undulate in a similar way to its biological counterpart using pressure for actuation power, without human intervention. With this approach, we develop an autonomous soft snake robot with on-board actuation, power, computation and control capabilities. The robot consists of four bidirectional fluidic elastomer actuators in series to create a traveling curvature wave from head to tail along its body. Passive wheels between segments generate the necessary frictional anisotropy for forward locomotion. It takes 14 h to build the soft robotic snake, which can attain an average locomotion speed of 19 mm s(-1).},

In this paper, we present a body-worn lower-extremity soft exosuit and a new control approach that can independently control the level of assistance that is provided during negative- and positive-power periods at the ankle. The exosuit was designed to create load paths assisting ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion, and the actuation system transmits forces from the motors to the suit via Bowden cables. A load cell and two gyro sensors per leg are used to measure real-time data, and the controller performs position control of the cable on a step-by-step basis with respect to the power delivered to the wearer's ankle by controlling two force parameters, the pretension and the active force. Human subjects testing results demonstrate that the controller is capable of modulating the amount of power delivered to the ankle joint. Also, significant reductions in metabolic rate (11{\%}-15{\%}) were observed, which indicates the potential of the proposed control approach to provide benefit to the wearer during walking.},

abstract = {We present a control methodology for underactuated aerial manipulators that is both easy to implement on real systems and able to achieve highly dynamic behaviours. The method is composed by two parts, a nominal input/state generator that takes into account the full-body nonlinear and coupled dynamics of the system, and a decentralized feedback controller acting on the actuated degrees of freedom that confers the needed robustness to the closed-loop system. We show how to apply the method to Protocentric Aerial Manipulators (PAM) by first using their differential flatness property on the vertical 2D plane in order to generate dynamical input/state trajectories, then statically extending the 2D structure to the 3D, and finally closing the loop with a decentralized controller having the dual task of both ensuring the preservation of the proper static 3D immersion and tracking the dynamic trajectory on the vertical plane. We demonstrate that the proposed controller is able to precisely track dynamic trajectories when implemented on a standard hardware composed by a quadrotor and a robotic arm with servo-controlled joints (even if no torque control is available). Comparative experiments clearly show the benefit of using the nominal input/state generator, and also the fact that the use of just static gravity compensation might surprisingly perform worse, in dynamic maneuvers, than the case of no compensation at all. We complement the experiments with additional realistic simulations testing the applicability of the proposed method to slightly non-protocentric aerial manipulators.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, path planning and trajectory optimization are performed using newly developed methodologies and results are compared with existing state-of-the-art techniques. Different state-of-the-art path planning techniques are discussed and compared not only in terms of numerical accuracy but also in terms of other properties. Trajectory optimization of a predefined geometri- cal path is discussed using three different optimization techniques: Phase-Plane method, Dynamic Programming and the newly developed method Discrete Me- chanics and Optimal Control (DMOC). A joint selection criterion and modifi- cation in the algorithm are presented to remove the flaws present in Dynamic Programming using Joint Space for trajectory optimization. Two numerical ex- amples are considered to compare these optimization techniques. In this thesis, a novel idea is proposed to combine path planning and trajectory optimization in a single step. One of the biggest advantages of combining these two steps together is that all constraints, either on kinematics or on dynamic properties, are consid- ered in one step. DMOC is used to obtain the optimal solution of simultaneous path planning and trajectory optimization. The Delta parallel robot is used to verify the proposed generalized methodologies.},

abstract = {Finger impairment following stroke results in significant deficits in hand manipulation and the performance of everyday tasks. While recent advances in rehabilitation robotics have shown promise for facilitating functional improvement, it remains unclear how best to employ these devices to maximize benefits. Current devices for the hand, however, lack the capacity to fully explore the space of possible training paradigms. Particularly, they cannot provide the independent joint control and levels of velocity and torque required. To fill this need, we have developed a prototype for one digit, the cable actuated finger exoskeleton (CAFE), a three-degree-of-freedom robotic exoskeleton for the index finger. This paper presents the design and development of the CAFE, with performance testing results.},

abstract = {The octopus arm presents peculiar features, like the capability of bending in all directions, producing fast elongations, and varying its stiffness. Such features are very attractive from a robotics point of view. In the octopus, these unique motor capabilities are given by the peculiar muscular structure of the octopus arm, named muscular hydrostat, that creates a sort of antagonistic mechanism between different muscle fibres and reduce the contraction requirements for the single muscle. By taking inspiration from this, we propose the design of a robot arm completely soft and compliant, composed of silicone muscles that can contract and that are arranged according to the anatomy of the octopus arm. The contractile units are built with EAP (Electro-Active Polymer) technologies, with a particular geometry that increases the contraction range and force. Contraction tests on prototypes of the contracting units show a very good similarity with a theoretical model and support the possibility of building the whole robotic octopus-like arm.},

The reinforcement learning process can be trained quickly by ignoring the specific materials and structural properties of the soft robot.

The study compares an experimental group receiving traditional therapy combined with HandTutorTM treatment, against a control group receiving only traditional therapy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: An assessor-blinded, randomized controlled pilot trial, was conducted in the Reuth rehabilitation unit in Israel. Thirty-one stroke patients in the sub-acute phase, were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (experimental or control) in sets of three. The experimental group (n = 16) underwent a hand rehabilitation programme using the HandTutorTM combined with traditional therapy. The control group (n = 15) received only traditional therapy. The treatment schedules for both groups were of similar duration and frequency. Improvements were evaluated using three indicators: 1) The Brunnstr{\"{o}}m-Fugl-Meyer (FM) test, 2) the Box and Blocks (B{\&}B) test and 3) improvement parameters as determined by the HandTutorTM software.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Following 15 consecutive treatment sessions, a signifi cant improvement was observed within the experimental group (95{\%} confi dence intervals) compared with the control group: B{\&}B p = 0.015; FM p = 0.041, HandTutor™ performance accuracy on x axis and performance accuracy on y axis p {\textless} 0.0003.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results from this pilot study support further investigation of the use of the HandTutorTM in combination with traditional occupational therapy and physiotherapy during post stroke hand function rehabilitation.},

sensor bias calculation for angle only sensor models in a target
tracking scenario. It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are
employed by each sensor and that no measurements of known
landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved
through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from
each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each
sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is
used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This
pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of
sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and
Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance
is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant
biases on each sensor.},

abstract = {Policy search can in principle acquire complex strategies for control of robots and other autonomous systems. When the policy is trained to process raw sensory inputs, such as images and depth maps, it can also acquire a strategy that combines perception and control. However, effectively processing such complex inputs requires an expressive policy class, such as a large neural network. These high-dimensional policies are difficult to train, especially when learning to control safety-critical systems. We propose PLATO, an algorithm that trains complex control policies with supervised learning, using model-predictive control (MPC) to generate the supervision, hence never in need of running a partially trained and potentially unsafe policy. PLATO uses an adaptive training method to modify the behavior of MPC to gradually match the learned policy in order to generate training samples at states that are likely to be visited by the learned policy. PLATO also maintains the MPC cost as an objective to avoid highly undesirable actions that would result from strictly following the learned policy before it has been fully trained. We prove that this type of adaptive MPC expert produces supervision that leads to good long-horizon performance of the resulting policy. We also empirically demonstrate that MPC can still avoid dangerous on-policy actions in unexpected situations during training. Our empirical results on a set of challenging simulated aerial vehicle tasks demonstrate that, compared to prior methods, PLATO learns faster, experiences substantially fewer catastrophic failures (crashes) during training, and often converges to a better policy.},

abstract = {ToF cameras are now a mature technology that is widely being adopted to provide sensory input to robotic applications. Depending on the nature of the objects to be perceived and the viewing distance, we distinguish two groups of applications: those requiring to capture the whole scene and those centered on an object. It will be demonstrated that it is in this last group of applications, in which the robot has to locate and possibly manipulate an object, where the distinctive characteristics of ToF cameras can be better exploited. After presenting the physical sensor features and the calibration requirements of such cameras, we review some representative works highlighting for each one which of the distinctive ToF characteristics have been more essential. Even if at low resolution, the acquisition of 3D images at frame-rate is one of the most important features, as it enables quick background/ foreground segmentation. A common use is in combination with classical color cameras. We present three developed applications, using a mobile robot and a robotic arm, to exemplify with real images some of the stated advantages. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower.},

Composites consisting of silicone elastomer, polyaramid fabric, and hollow glass microspheres were used to fabricate a sufficiently large soft robot to carry the miniature air compressors, battery, valves, and controller needed for autonomous operation. Fabrication techniques were developed to mold a 0.65-meter-long soft body with modified Pneu-Net actuators capable of operating at the elevated pressures (up to 138?kPa) required to actuate the legs of the robot and hold payloads of up to 8?kg. The soft robot is safe to interact with during operation, and its silicone body is innately resilient to a variety of adverse environmental conditions including snow, puddles of water, direct (albeit limited) exposure to flames, and the crushing force of being run over by an automobile.},

abstract = {Locomoting soft robots typically walk or crawl slowly relative to their rigid counterparts. In order to execute agile behaviors such as jumping, rapid actuation modes are required. Here we present an untethered soft-bodied robot that uses a combination of pneumatic and explosive actuators to execute directional jumping maneuvers. This robot can autonomously jump up to 0.6 meters laterally with an apex of up to 0.6 meters (7.5 times it's body height) and can achieve targeted jumping onto an object. The robot is able to execute these directed jumps while carrying the required fuel, pneumatics, control electronics, and battery. We also present a thermodynamic model for the combustion of butane used to power jumping, and calculate the theoretical maximum work output for the design. From experimental results, we find the mechanical efficiency of this prototype to be 0.8{\%}.},

abstract = {We present a policy search method for learning complex feedback control policies that map from high-dimensional sensory inputs to motor torques, for manipulation tasks with discontinuous contact dynamics. We build on a prior technique called guided policy search (GPS), which iteratively optimizes a set of local policies for specific instances of a task, and uses these to train a complex, high-dimensional global policy that generalizes across task instances. We extend GPS in the following ways: (1) we propose the use of a model-free local optimizer based on path integral stochastic optimal control (PI2), which enables us to learn local policies for tasks with highly discontinuous contact dynamics; and (2) we enable GPS to train on a new set of task instances in every iteration by using on-policy sampling: this increases the diversity of the instances that the policy is trained on, and is crucial for achieving good generalization. We show that these contributions enable us to learn deep neural network policies that can directly perform torque control from visual input. We validate the method on a challenging door opening task and a pick-and-place task, and we demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the prior LQR-based local policy optimizer on these tasks. Furthermore, we show that on-policy sampling significantly increases the generalization ability of these policies.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a computationally efficient approach to detecting objects natively in 3D point clouds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In particular, this is achieved by leveraging a feature-centric voting scheme to implement novel convolutional layers which explicitly exploit the sparsity encountered in the input. To this end, we examine the trade-off between accuracy and speed for different architectures and additionally propose to use an L1 penalty on the filter activations to further encourage sparsity in the intermediate representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose sparse convolutional layers and L1 regularisation for efficient large-scale processing of 3D data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the KITTI object detection benchmark and show that Vote3Deep models with as few as three layers outperform the previous state of the art in both laser and laser-vision based approaches by margins of up to 40{\%} while remaining highly competitive in terms of processing time.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel method for designing the transducer of a highly directional ultrasonic range sensor for detecting obstacles in mobile robot applications. The transducer consists of wave generation, amplification, and radiation sections, and a countermass. The operating principle of this design is based on the parametric array method where the frequency difference between two ultrasonic waves is used to generate a highly directional low-frequency wave with a small aperture. The aim of this study was to design an optimal transducer to generate the two simultaneous longitudinal modes efficiently. We first derived an appropriate mathematical model by combining the continuum model of a bar and countermass with the compatibility condition between a piezoelectric actuator and a linear horn. Then we determined the optimal length of the aluminum horn and the piezoelectric actuator using a finite element method. The proposed sensor exhibited a half-power bandwidth of less than ??1.3?? at 44.8 kHz, a much higher directivity than existing conventional ultrasonic range sensors. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wettergreen1995,
abstract = {A substantial portion of the Earth is inaccessible to any sort of wheeled mechanism— natural obstacles like large rocks, loose soil, deep ravines, and steep slopes conspire to render rolling locomotion ineffective. Hills, mountains, shores, seabeds, as well as the moon and other planets present similar terrain challenges. In many of these natural terrains, legs are well-suited. They can avoid small obstacles by making discrete contacts and passing up undesirable footholds. Legged mechanisms can climb over obstacles and step across ditches, surmounting terrain discontinuities of body-scale while staying level and stable. To achieve their potential, legged robots must coordinate their leg motions to climb over, step across and walk in natural terrain. These coordinated motions, which support and propel the robot, are called a gait. This thesis develops a new method of gait planning and control that enables statically-stable walking robots to produce a gait that is robust and productive in natural terrain. Independent task-achieving processes, called gait behaviors, establish a nominal gait, adapt it to the terrain, and react to disturbances like bumps and slips. Gait controlled in this way enabled the robot Dante II to walk autonomously in natural terrain, including the volcanic crater of Mount Spurr. This method extends to other walking robots as demonstrated by a generalized hexapod that performs the variety of gaits seen in six- legged insects, as well as aperiodic free gaits. The ability to change gait patterns on-the- fly with continuous, stable motion is a new development that enables robots to behave more like animals in adapting their gait to terrain. Finally, this thesis describes why walking robots need predictive plans as well as reflexive behaviors to walk effectively in the real world. It presents a method of guiding the behavior of a walking robot by planning distinct attributes of the desired gait. This partitioning of gait planning avoids the complexity of high degree-of-freedom motion planning. The ability to plan and foresee changes in gait improves performance while maintaining robust safety and stability.},

abstract = {— With systems performing Simultaneous Localiza-tion And Mapping (SLAM) from a single robot reaching considerable maturity, the possibility of employing a team of robots to collaboratively perform a task has been attracting increasing interest. Promising great impact in a plethora of tasks ranging from industrial inspection to digitization of archaeological structures, collaborative scene perception and mapping are key in efficient and effective estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel, centralized architecture for collaborative monocular SLAM employing multiple small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to act as agents. Each agent is able to independently explore the environment running limited-memory SLAM onboard, while sending all collected information to a central server, a ground station with increased computational resources. The server manages the maps of all agents, triggering loop closure, map fusion, optimization and distribution of information back to the agents. This allows an agent to incorporate observations from others in its SLAM estimates on the fly. We put the proposed framework to the test employing a nominal keyframe-based monocular SLAM algorithm, demonstrating the applicability of this system in multi-UAV scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method for the control of soft robots with elastic behavior, piloted by several actuators. The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone.},

abstract = {— A new type of wrist-mounted robot, the Supernumerary Robotic (SR) Fingers, is proposed to work closely with the human hand and aid the human in performing a variety of prehensile tasks. For people with diminished functionality of their hands, these robotic fingers could provide the opportunity to live with more independence and work more productively. A natural and implicit coordination between the SR Fingers and the human fingers is required so the robot can be transformed to act as part of the human body. This paper presents a novel control algorithm, termed " Bio-Artificial Synergies " , which enables the SR and human fingers to share the task load together and adapt to diverse task conditions. Through grasp experiments and data analysis, postural synergies were found for a seven-fingered hand comprised of two SR Fingers and five human fingers. The synergy-based control law was then extracted from the experimental data using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and tested on the SR Finger prototype as a proof of concept.},

abstract = {Design of continuum robots, i.e. robots with continuous backbones, has been an active area of research in robotics for minimally invasive surgery, search and rescue, object manipulation, etc. Along the same lines, NASA developed "Tendril", the first long and thin continuum robot of its kind, intended for in-space inspection applications. The thesis starts with describing and discussing the key disadvantages of the current state of the art mechanical design of "Tendril'' producing undesirable effects during operation. It then includes the design specifics of a novel concept for construction of a next generation long and thin, space-cable, multi-section, continuum cable-like robot, with a modified mechanical design for better performance. The new design possesses key features including controllable bending along its entire length, local compression and a compact actuation package. This new design is detailed in two versions. The first is a planar variant (suited for a 2D workspace), explaining the principle which allows the cable robot to achieve the above mentioned features. It is followed by a refined spatial version (suited for 3D workspace), where the functional characteristics are achieved within the desired aspect ratio of thin (less than 1 cm diameter) and relatively longer length (more than 100 cm) of the robotic cable. A new forward kinematic model is then developed extending the established models for constant-curvature continuum robots, to account for the new design feature of controllable compression (in the hardware) and is validated by performing experiments with the robot in (2D) planar and (3D) spatial scenarios. This new model is found to be effective as a baseline to predict the performance of such a long and thin continuum "cable" robot.},

Arthrobots combine mechanical compliance, lightweight and simple construction, and inexpensive yet scalable design. An exoskeleton, constructed from thin organic polymeric tubes, provides lightweight structural support. Pneumatic joints modeled after the hydrostatic joints of spiders provide actuation and inherent mechanical compliance to external forces. An inflatable elastomeric tube (a ''balloon'') enables active extension of a limb; an opposing elastic tendon enables passive retraction. A variety of robots constructed from these structural elements demonstrate (i) crawling with one or two limbs, (ii) walking with four or six limbs (including an insect-like triangular gait), (iii) walking with eight limbs, or (iv) floating and rowing on the surface of water.

abstract = {Legged robots have the potential to navigate in more challenging terrain than wheeled robots do. Unfortunately, their control is more difficult because they have to deal with the traditional mapping and path planning problems, as well as foothold computation, leg trajectories and posture control in order to achieve successful navigation. Many parameters need to be adjusted in real time to keep the robot stable and safe while it is moving. In this paper, we will present a new framework for a quadruped robot, which performs goal-oriented navigation on unknown rough terrain by using inertial measurement data and stereo vision. This framework includes perception and control, and allows the robot to navigate in a straight line forward to a visual goal in a difficult environment. The developed rough terrain locomotion system does not need any mapping or path planning: the stereo camera is used to visually guide the robot and evaluate the terrain roughness and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used for posture control. This new framework is an important step forward to achieve fully autonomous navigation because in the case of problems in the SLAM mapping, a reactive locomotion controller is always active. This ensures stable locomotion in rough terrain, by combining direct visual feedback and inertial measurements. By implementing this controller, an autonomous navigation system has been developed, which is goal-oriented and overcomes disturbances from the ground, the robot weight, or external forces. Indoor and outdoor experiments with our quadruped robot show the effectiveness and the robustness of this framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The motion generation is a unified way to design both walking and running and can generate the trajectory with the vertical conditions of the Center Of Mass (COM) in short calculation time. The balance control enables a robot to maintain balance by changing the positions of the contact foot dynamically when the robot is disturbed. This control consists of 1) compliance control without force sensors, in which the joints are made compliant by feed-forward torques and adjustment of gains of position control, and 2) feedback control, which uses the measured orientation of the robot's torso used in the motion generation as an initial condition to decide the foot positions. Finally, a human-sized humanoid robot that can run forward at 7.0 [km/h] is presented.},

However, state-of-the-art asymmetric-tip robotic needle steering systems do not yet achieve clinically relevant curvature. This work presents the design and development of a highly articulated needle that enables distributed RFA in liver tissue under ultrasound (US) image guidance. Our new needle design attains the target curvature required for liver procedures while meeting important clinical requirements such as the use of fixed diameter needle introducers, presence of a free needle working channel, robustness for repeated insertions, and conductivity for the delivery of RF current for tissue ablation. The new needle tip includes two important design features: a tendon-actuated Nitinol asymmetric flexure joint, which allows for an active amplification of the needle steering force, and a steel back-bevel tip profile, which decreases the risk of needle jamming. The needle's resulting curvature was evaluated in both phantom and ex-vivo liver tissues using segmented US images. The average radius of minimum curvature in ex-vivo liver tissue was found to be 33.6 mm, the smallest reported to date. Furthermore, RFA in ex-vivo porcine liver tissue tests were performed to demonstrate that distributed ablation with a single puncture of the liver capsule is possible via robotic needle steering.},

We investigate how the software abstractions of the existing Robot Control Interface (RCI) and the Compliant Control Architecture (CCA) can deal with this platform from a software modeling and software architectural perspective. We focus on three different challenges: the first challenge is to enable reasonable and hierarchical semantic abstractions of the robot. The second challenge is to develop hardware I/O abstractions for the prototypical and heterogeneous technical setup. The third challenge is to realize this in a flexible and reusable manner. We evaluate our approaches to the above challenges in a practical scenario in which the robot is controlled either in simulation or on the real robot. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Scientists are exploring elastic and soft forms of robots, electronic skin and energy harvesters, dreaming to mimic nature and to enable novel applications in wide fields, from consumer and mobile appliances to biomedical systems, sports and healthcare. All conceivable classes of materials with a wide range of mechanical, physical and chemical properties are employed, from liquids and gels to organic and inorganic solids. Functionalities never seen before are achieved. In this review we discuss soft robots which allow actuation with several degrees of freedom. We show that different actuation mechanisms lead to similar actuators, capable of complex and smooth movements in 3d space. We introduce latest research examples in sensor skin development and discuss ultraflexible electronic circuits, light emitting diodes and solar cells as examples. Additional functionalities of sensor skin, such as visual sensors inspired by animal eyes, camouflage, self-cleaning and healing and on-skin energy storage and generation are briefly reviewed. Finally, we discuss a paradigm change in energy harvesting, away from hard energy generators to soft ones based on dielectric elastomers. Such systems are shown to work with high energy of conversion, making them potentially interesting for harvesting mechanical energy from human gait, winds and ocean waves.},

@article{Mur-Artal2016,
abstract = {In recent years there have been excellent results in Visual-Inertial Odometry techniques, which aim to compute the incremental motion of the sensor with high accuracy and robustness. However these approaches lack the capability to close loops, and trajectory estimation accumulates drift even if the sensor is continually revisiting the same place. In this work we present a novel tightly-coupled Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system that is able to close loops and reuse its map to achieve zero-drift localization in already mapped areas. While our approach can be applied to any camera configuration, we address here the most general problem of a monocular camera, with its well-known scale ambiguity. We also propose a novel IMU initialization method, which computes the scale, the gravity direction, the velocity, and gyroscope and accelerometer biases, in a few seconds with high accuracy. We test our system in the 11 sequences of a recent micro-aerial vehicle public dataset achieving a typical scale factor error of 1{\%} and centimeter precision. We compare to the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial odometry in sequences with revisiting, proving the better accuracy of our method due to map reuse and no drift accumulation.},

However, in a clinical setting for rehabilitation where one exoskeleton is shared by multiple patients, it will be difficult to guarantee on-site adjustments can make the rigid exoskeleton fit each patient kinematically perfectly. This paper proposed an alternative exoskeleton design that uses compliant continuum mechanisms. Its intrinsic flexibility adapts to different human anatomy automatically. Design concepts and component descriptions were elaborated for this shoulder exoskeleton, including kinematics, construction, actuation, transmission schemes, etc. A series of experiments were conducted to characterize shapes of the flexible members within the continuum structure as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of using such an exoskeleton to assist different patients with their limb motions.},

To this end, we employ a single MPC which uses a combination of Center of Pressure (CoP) manipulation, step adjustment, and Centroidal Moment Pivot (CMP) modulation to design a robust walking controller. Furthermore, we exploit the concept of time-varying DCM to generalize our walking controller for walking in uneven surfaces. Using our scheme, a general and robust walking controller is designed which can be implemented on robots with different control authorities, for walking on various environments, e.g. uneven terrains or surfaces with a very limited feasible area for stepping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through simulations on different scenarios and comparison to the state of the art.},

abstract = {Functionality of a human hand can be augmented with wearable robotic fingers to enable grasping and manipulation of objects with a single hand. Such technology will have applications in manufacturing and construction, as well as health care. This paper presents a method for controlling extra robotic fingers, termed “Supernumerary Robotic Fingers (SR Fingers),” in coordination with human fingers to grasp diverse objects. Two hypotheses are proposed and verified through experiments. One is that humans prefer grasp posture of their fingers and that of the SR Fingers to be highly correlated when working together, which is represented with a few principal components, resembling grasp synergy in neuromotor control. The other hypothesis is that SR Finger posture can be controlled to coordinate with human finger posture via grasp synergy of the hybrid human–robotic hand. Partial least squares regression is used for predicting a desired posture of the SR Fingers from the measurement of human fingers. This method is implemented on a pair of wrist-mounted SR Fingers. Experiments demonstrate that the prototype SR Fingers can assist the human user in performing single-handed grasping tasks without requiring explicit commands.},

abstract = {A new method for bipedal walking on rough terrain by using ZMP criteria map is proposed. The rough terrain walking is classified to ldquostep uprdquo and ldquostep downrdquo by landing timing of a swing leg. The walking pattern is modified in real-time according to the difference between the ideal timing and the measured timing by a force sensor on the foot. In the case of ldquostep uprdquo, the landing timing is faster than the ideal, and the swing leg trajectory should be change to follow the step so that the ZMP based balance of the sudden caused double support phase is kept. In the case of ldquostep downrdquo, the landing timing is later than the ideal, and the swing leg trajectory should be change to seek the ground so that the balance of the unknown future double support phase is kept. The modified walking pattern is decided based on the ZMP criteria map. The ZMP criteria map can indicate a safe landing timing and landing position of a swing leg. By referring the ZMP criteria map, the robust walking pattern can be planned. The proposed method is implemented to HRP-2, and the effectiveness is confirmed through experiments.},

abstract = {We present a framework for online generation of robust motion plans for robotic systems with nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded disturbances, control constraints, and online state constraints such as obstacles. In an offline phase, one computes the structure of a feedback controller that can be efficiently implemented online to track any feasible nominal trajectory. The offline phase leverages contraction theory and convex optimization to characterize a fixed-size " tube " that the state is guaranteed to remain within while tracking a nominal trajectory (representing the center of the tube). In the online phase, when the robot is faced with obstacles, a motion planner uses such a tube as a robustness margin for collision checking, yielding nominal trajectories that can be safely executed (i.e., tracked without collisions under disturbances). In contrast to recent work on robust online planning using funnel libraries, our approach is not restricted to a fixed library of maneuvers computed offline and is thus particularly well-suited to applications such as UAV flight in densely cluttered environments where complex maneuvers may be required to reach a goal. We demonstrate our approach through simulations of a 6-state planar quadrotor navigating cluttered environments in the presence of a cross-wind. We also discuss applications of our approach to Tube Model Predictive Control (TMPC) and compare the merits of our method with state-of-the-art nonlinear TMPC techniques.},

abstract = {The necessity for efficient control of soft actuators has recently resulted in the development of complex physical models that are actuator geometry and material type dependent. In this paper, we address the ability to do closed-loop control with a simplified model independent of material properties and material characteristics of a soft robotic system. We demonstrate this by using a P-controller on a new 3-chambered, fiber-reinforced elastomeric actuator (3CA) that utilizes off-the-shelf stretch sensors. A motion capture system is used to calibrate and generate two different quasi-static models (a general linear regression model and an input dependent model) that map the varying chamber pressure readings with the actuator's end effector position, effectively represented by the stretch sensor curvature. Simulations using a closed-loop controller, with both models, provide further insight on the quality of the models and corresponding control performance. We use this information in an experimental study that yields comparable performances to the simulated results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input-dependent model based controller can provide better results than that of the general model based controller. Finally, we demonstrate that our soft actuator can be closed-loop controlled with off-the-shelf stretch sensors with repeatable results. This opens a way to design new control concepts for multi-chambered actuators that can produce more complex motions in the future.},

There is demand for high performance tactile sensor which can support robotic grippers in manipulation tasks especially for unstructured flexible objects. Despite the efforts that have been spent, the fabrication process of those functional sensor remains complicated due to their requirement of specialized materials and equipment. The proposed multimodal sensor overcomes the difficulty by enhancing the electrical and mechanical design therefore simplifying the manufacture steps. In this version, static and dynamic sensing are integrated in the same layer of capacitive sensor with direct written microstructured dielectric. This structure allows it to have large range of force sensing as well as the ability of detecting contact events such as slippage or losing of contact.},

Aim of our project LittleApe is to build a small and extreme lightweight robot that is capable of walking on two and four legs as well as of changing from a four-legged posture to a two-legged posture, manipulating small objects, and which is also able to climb. LittleApe is modelled with attributes of a chimpanzee regarding limb proportions, spinal column, centre of mass, walking pattern, and range of motion. The concept of LittleApe is tested in simulation while building the real system. Two aspects were chosen to evaluate the concept described in detail within this paper. The first aspect comprises the use of an evolutionary method and the comparison of different morphologies. Based on the results from the first one, the second aspect deals with the manoeuvrability of the LittleApe robot.},

This project is aimed at developing a whole arm intelligent rehabilitation robot capable of controlling the shoulder, elbow, and wrist individually and simultaneously while allowing trunk motions, with the following integrated features: 1) it has unique diagnostic capabilities to determine which joints and which DOFs have significant changes in the neuromechanical properties, which joints lose independent control, what are the abnormal couplings, and whether the problem is due to changes in passive muscle properties or active control capabilities; 2) based on the diagnosis, it stretches the spastic/deformed joints forcefully under intelligent control to loosen up the specific stiff joints/DOFs; 3) with the stiff joints loosened up, the patients practice voluntary functional movements with assistance from the robot to regain/improve their motor control capability; and 4) the outcome is evaluated quantitatively at the levels of individual joints, multiple joints/DOFs, and the whole arm.},

This system, which complements an existing stereo vision system, is based on a line-scanning laser ranger viewing the area just in front of the rover. This configuration of the laser yields a fast response time and very high precision, but due to the short look-ahead only an emergency stop can be commanded. The system consists of a data acquisition module and a hazard detection module. The acquisition module retrieves and validates range data, performing integrity checks of the laser system and correcting minor problems if necessary. The detection module evaluates the elevation profile of the terrain looking for evidence of three different hazards: step, ditch, and belly. The laser system has been tested in lunar-like terrain with excellent performance: zero misses and few false alarms operating at 4 Hz},

abstract = {Undulatory motion of the body is the dominant mode of locomotion in fishes, and numerous studies of body kinematics and muscle activity patterns have provided insights into the mechanics of swimming. However, it has not been possible to investigate how key parameters such as the extent of bilateral muscle activation affect propulsive performance due to the inability to manipulate muscle activation in live, freely swimming fishes. In this article we extend previous work on passive flexible mechanical models of undulatory propulsion by using actively controlled pneumatic actuators attached to a flexible foil to gain insight into undulatory locomotion and mechanisms for body stiffness control. Two soft actuators were attached on each side of a flexible panel with stiffness comparable to that of a fish body. To study how bilateral contraction can be used to modify axial body stiffness during swimming, we ran a parameter sweep of actuator contraction phasing and frequency. Thrust production by the soft pneumatic actuators was tested at cyclic undulation frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 Hz in a recirculating flow tank at flow speeds up to 28 cm/s. Overall, this system generated more thrust at higher tail beat frequencies, with a plateau in thrust above 0.8 Hz. Self-propelled speed was found to be 0.8 foil lengths per second or *13 cm/s when actuated at 0.55 Hz. This active pneumatic model is capable of producing substantial trailing edge amplitudes with a maximum excursion equivalent to 1.4 foil lengths, and of generating considerable thrust. Altering the extent of bilateral co-contraction in a range from -22{\%} to 17{\%} of the cycle period showed that thrust was maximized with some amount of simultaneous left-right actuation of *3{\%} to 6{\%} of the cycle period. When the system is exposed to water flow, thrust was substantially reduced for conditions of greatest antagonistic overlap in left-right actuation, and also for the largest latencies introduced. This experi-mental platform provides a soft robotic testbed for studying aquatic propulsion with active control of undulatory kinematics.},

abstract = {A remarkably diverse group of organisms rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support, movement, muscular antagonism and the amplification of the force and displacement of muscle contraction. In hydrostatic skeletons, force is transmitted not through rigid skeletal elements but instead by internal pressure. Functioning of these systems depends on the fact that they are essentially constant in volume as they consist of relatively incompressible fluids and tissue. Contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension. By actively (with muscle) or passively (with connective tissue) controlling the various dimensions, a wide array of deformations, movements and changes in stiffness can be created. An amazing range of animals and animal structures rely on this form of skeletal support, including anemones and other polyps, the extremely diverse wormlike invertebrates, the tube feet of echinoderms, mammalian and turtle penises, the feet of burrowing bivalves and snails, and the legs of spiders. In addition, there are structures such as the arms and tentacles of cephalopods, the tongue of mammals and the trunk of the elephant that also rely on hydrostatic skeletal support but lack the fluid-filled cavities that characterize this skeletal type. Although we normally consider arthropods to rely on a rigid exoskeleton, a hydrostatic skeleton provides skeletal support immediately following molting and also during the larval stage for many insects. Thus, the majority of animals on earth rely on hydrostatic skeletons.},

A new scene functionality testing-bed, which is complied from two publicly available indoor scene datasets, is used for evaluation. Our method is evaluated quantitatively on the new dataset, demonstrating the ability to perform efficient recognition of functional areas from arbitrary indoor scenes. We also demonstrate that our detection model can be generalized onto novel indoor scenes by cross validating it with the images from two different datasets.},

abstract = { A new method for repositioning a rigid body with a flexible sheet is developed and is applied to a rehabilitation bed for turning and transferring a bedridden patient to alleviate bedsores and other ailments. The patient position and orientation are fully controlled by manipulating a flexible bed sheet under no-slip conditions. The use of a flexible sheet and the untethered nature of manipulation make the repositioning method particularly well suited to handling the human body. First, the basic design concept of the rehabilitation bed for automated patient repositioning is presented. The kinematic and static behaviors of body-sheet interactions are analyzed, and conditions for no-slip, quasi-static repositioning are obtained. In order to prevent injury to the patient's fragile skin, it must be ensured that the patient does not slip on the sheet during repositioning. A prototype bed with a pair of servoed arms for manipulating the bed sheet is developed, and the no-slip conditions and the repositioning method are experimentally verified. A closed-loop control based on the measurement of a patient's position and orientation is implemented and tested. Note to Practitioners-This work was motivated by the problems faced by bedridden patients as well as caregivers in the healthcare industry. The labor-intensive repositioning and transfer of bedridden patients are performed with a robotic system supervised by a single caregiver. Our repositioning scheme uses the bed sheet for rolling and moving the patient and closely mimics the current practice prevalent in nursing homes and hospitals. Our approach will be a natural alternative to manual repositioning and transfer and will be acceptable for most caregivers and patients. Initial prototyping and experiments have been completed in consultation with a professional caregiver.},

abstract = {Choose the Correct Solution Method for Your Optimization Problem Optimization: Algorithms and Applications presents a variety of solution techniques for optimization problems, emphasizing concepts rather than rigorous mathematical details and proofs. The book covers both gradient and stochastic methods as solution techniques for unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. It discusses the conjugate gradient method, Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm, Powell method, penalty function, augmented Lagrange multiplier method, sequential quadratic programming, method of feasible directions, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, and tabu search methods. The author shows how to solve non-convex multi-objective optimization problems using simple modifications of the basic PSO code. The book also introduces multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) architectures―one of the first optimization books to do so―and develops software codes for the simplex method and affine-scaling interior point method for solving linear programming problems. In addition, it examines Gomory's cutting plane method, the branch-and-bound method, and Balas' algorithm for integer programming problems. The author follows a step-by-step approach to developing the MATLAB{\textregistered} codes from the algorithms. He then applies the codes to solve both standard functions taken from the literature and real-world applications, including a complex trajectory design problem of a robot, a portfolio optimization problem, and a multi-objective shape optimization problem of a reentry body. This hands-on approach improves your understanding and confidence in handling different solution methods. The MATLAB codes are available on the book's CRC Press web page.},

Biomim. 7 025004 Abstract Octopuses are molluscs that belong to the group Cephalopoda. They lack joints and rigid links, and as a result, their arms possess virtually limitless freedom of movement. These flexible appendages exhibit peculiar biomechanical features such as stiffness control, compliance, and high flexibility and dexterity. Studying the capabilities of the octopus arm is a complex task that presents a challenge for both biologists and roboticists, the latter of whom draw inspiration from the octopus in designing novel technologies within soft robotics. With this idea in mind, in this study, we used new, purposively developed methods of analysing the octopus arm in vivo to create new biologically inspired design concepts. Our measurements showed that the octopus arm can elongate by 70{\%} in tandem with a 23{\%} diameter reduction and exhibits an average pulling force of 40 N. The arm also exhibited a 20{\%} mean shortening at a rate of 17.1 mm s −1 and a longitudinal stiffening rate as high as 2 N (mm s) −1 . Using histology and ultrasounds, we investigated the functional morphology of the internal tissues, including the sinusoidal arrangement of the nerve cord and the local insertion points of the longitudinal and transverse muscle fibres. The resulting information was used to create novel design principles and specifications that can in turn be used in developing a new soft robotic arm.

abstract = {This paper describes the design and development of a robot with six soft limbs, with the dual capability of pushing-based locomotion and grasping by wrapping around objects. Specifically, a central platform lodges six silicone limbs, radially distributed, with cables embedded. A new mechanism-specific gait, invariant regarding the number of limbs, has been implemented. Functionally, some limbs provide stability while others push and pull the robot to locomote in the desired direction. Once the robot is close to a target, one limb is elected to wrap around the object and, thanks to the particular limb structure and the soft material, a friction-based grasping is achieved. The robot is inspired by the octopus and implements the key principles of locomotion in this animal, without coping the full body structure. For this reason it works in water, but it is not restricted to this environment. The experiments show the effectiveness of the original solution in locomotion and grasping.},

In a first application example, we solve kinematic trajectory planning problems for a 26 DoF wheeled robot. In a second example, we apply Constrained SLQ to a real-world mobile manipulator in a receding-horizon optimal control fashion, where we obtain optimal controllers and plans at rates up to 100 Hz.},

abstract = {Navigation and obstacle avoidance in robotics using planar laser scans has matured over the last decades. They basically enable robots to penetrate highly dynamic and populated spaces, such as people's home, and move around smoothly. However, in an unconstrained environment the two-dimensional perceptual space of a fixed mounted laser is not sufficient to ensure safe navigation. In this paper, we present an approach that pools a fast and reliable motion generation approach with modern 3D capturing techniques using a time-of-flight camera. Instead of attempting to implement full 3D motion control, which is computationally more expensive and simply not needed for the targeted scenario of a domestic robot, we introduce a ldquovirtual laserrdquo. For the originally solely laser-based motion generation the technique of fusing real laser measurements and 3D point clouds into a continuous data stream is 100{\%} compatible and transparent. The paper covers the general concept, the necessary extrinsic calibration of two very different types of sensors, and exemplarily illustrates the benefit which is to avoid obstacles not being perceivable in the original laser scan.},

The use of soft materials in robotics, driven not only by new scientific paradigms (biomimetics, morphological computation, and others), but also by many applications (biomedical, service, rescue robots, and many more), is going to overcome these basic assumptions and makes the well-known theories and techniques poorly applicable, opening new perspectives for robot design and control. The current examples of soft robots represent a variety of solutions for actuation and control. Though very first steps, they have the potential for a radical technological change. Soft robotics is not just a new direction of technological development, but a novel approach to robotics, unhinging its fundamentals, with the potential to produce a new generation of robots, in the support of humans in our natural environments.},

This test was conducted in 40 elderly patients with a range of balance function. Tests were recorded on video tapes, which were viewed by groups of observers from different medical backgrounds. Balance function was scored on a five-point scale. The same patients underwent laboratory tests of gait and balance. There was agreement among observers on the subjective scoring of the clinical test, and good correlation with laboratory tests. The get-up and go test proved to be a satisfactory clinical measure of balance in elderly people.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of computing shortest paths in a dense motion-planning roadmap {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}. We assume that {\$}n{\$}, the number of vertices of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}, is very large. Thus, using any path-planning algorithm that directly searches {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}, running in {\$}O(n{\^{}}2){\$} time, becomes unacceptably expensive. We are therefore interested in anytime search algorithms that obtain successively shorter feasible paths and converge to the shortest path in {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}. Our key insight is to leverage existing path-planning algorithms and provide them with a sequence of subgraphs of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}. To do so, we study the space of all ({\$}r{\$}-disk) subgraphs of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}. We then formulate and present two densification strategies for traversing this space which exhibit complementary properties with respect to problem difficulty. This inspires a third, hybrid strategy which has favourable properties regardless of problem difficulty. This general approach is then demonstrated and analyzed using the specific case where a low-dispersion deterministic sequence is used to generate the samples used for {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}G{\}}{\$}. Finally we empirically evaluate the performance of our strategies for random scenarios in {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}{\{}4{\}}{\$} and on manipulation planning problems for a 7 DOF robot arm, and validate our analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel miniature robotic endoscope that is small enough to pass through the eustachian tube and provide visualization of the middle ear (ME). The device features a miniature bending tip previously conceived of as a small-scale robotic wrist that has been adapted to carry and aim a small chip-tip camera and fiber optic light sources. The motivation for trans-eustachian tube ME inspection is to provide a natural-orifice-based route to the ME that does not require cutting or lifting the eardrum, as is currently required. In this paper, we first perform an analysis of the ME anatomy and use a computational design optimization platform to derive the kinematic requirements for endoscopic inspection of the ME through the eustachian tube. Based on these requirements, we fabricate the proposed device and use it to demonstrate the feasibility of ME inspection in an anthropomorphic model, i.e. a 3D-printed ME phantom generated from patient image data. We show that our prototype provides 74.16{\%} visibility coverage of the sinus tympani, a region of the ME crucial for diagnosis, compared to an average of only 6.9{\%} using a straight, nonarticulated endoscope through the Eustachian Tube.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, we apply the framework of ensemble control theory to derive an approximate steering algorithm for two classical robotic systems— the nonholonomic unicycle and the plate-ball manipulator—in the presence of model perturbation that scales all inputs by an unknown but bounded constant. The basic idea is to maintain the set of all possible configurations and to select inputs that reduce the size of this set and drive it toward some goal con-figuration. The key insight is that the evolution of this set can be described by a family of control systems that depend continuously on the unknown con-stant. Ensemble control theory provides conditions under which it is possible to steer this entire family to a neighborhood of the goal configuration with a single open-loop input trajectory. For both the nonholonomic unicycle and the plate-ball manipulator, we show how to construct this trajectory using piecewise-constant inputs. We also validate our approach with hardware ex-periments, where the nonholonomic unicycle is a differential-drive robot with unknown wheel size, and the plate-ball manipulator is a planar motion stage that uses magnetic actuation to orient a sphere of unknown radius. We conclude by showing how the same framework can be applied to feed-back control of multi-robot systems under the constraint that every robot receives exactly the same control input. We focus on the nonholonomic uni-cycle, instantiated in experiment by a collection of differential-drive robots. Assuming that each robot has a unique wheel size, we derive a globally asymptotically stabilizing feedback control policy. We show that this policy is robust to standard models of noise and scales to an arbitrary number of robots. These results suggest that our approach may have possible future application to control of micro-and nano-scale robotic systems, which are often subject to similar constraints. ii},

A generalization of the linear programming chunking algorithm for arbitrary kernels is implemented for solving problems with very large datasets wherein chunking is performed on both data points and problem variables. The proposed approach tolerates a small error, which is adjusted parametrically, while fitting the given data. This leads to improved fitting of noisy data (over ordinary least error solutions) as demonstrated computationally. Comparative numerical results indicate an average time reduction as high as 26.0{\%} over other formulations, with a maximal time reduction of 79.7{\%}. Additionally, linear programs with as many as 16,000 data points and more than a billion nonzero matrix elements are solved.},

To perform this task, the robot learns a pixel-level inverse dynamics model of rope manipulation directly from images in a self-supervised manner, using about 60K interactions with the rope collected autonomously by the robot. The human demonstration provides a high-level plan of what to do and the low-level inverse model is used to execute the plan. We show that by combining the high and low-level plans, the robot can successfully manipulate a rope into a variety of target shapes using only a sequence of human-provided images for direction.},

Extreme twisting produces coiled muscles that can contract by 49{\%}, lift loads over 100 times heavier than can human muscle of the same length and weight, and generate 5.3 kilowatts of mechanical work per kilogram of muscle weight, similar to that produced by a jet engine. Woven textiles that change porosity in response to temperature and actuating window shutters that could help conserve energy were also demonstrated.

abstract = {Each year, the American Heart Association (AHA), in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies, brings together the most up-to-date statistics on heart disease, stroke, other vascular diseases, and their risk factors and presents them in its Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update. The Statistical Update is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, healthcare policy makers, media professionals, the lay public, and many others who seek the best national data available on disease morbidity and mortality and the risks, quality of care, medical procedures and operations, and costs associated with the management of these diseases in a single document. Indeed, since 1999, the Statistical Update has been cited more than 8700 times in the literature (including citations of all annual versions). In 2010 alone, the various Statistical Updates were cited 1600 times (data from ISI Web of Science). In recent years, the Statistical Update has undergone some major changes with the addition of new chapters and major updates across multiple areas. For this year's edition, the Statistics Committee, which produces the document for the AHA, updated all of the current chapters with the most recent nationally representative data and inclusion of relevant articles from the literature over the past year and added a new chapter detailing various disorders of heart rhythm. Also, the 2012 Statistical Update is a major source for monitoring both cardiovascular health and disease in the population, with a focus on progress toward achievement of the AHA's 2020 Impact Goals. Below are a few highlights from this year's Update.},

abstract = {This paper details the design and fabrication process of a fully integrated soft humanoid robotic hand with five finger that integrate an embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator and a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) flexure sensor. Several challenges including precise control of the SMA actuator, improving power efficiency, and reducing actuation current and response time have been addressed. First, a Ni-Ti SMA strip is pretrained to a circular shape. Second, it is wrapped with a Ni-Cr resistance wire that is coated with thermally conductive and electrically isolating material. This design significantly reduces actuation current, improves circuit efficiency, and hence reduces response time and increases power efficiency. Third, an antagonistic SMA strip is used to improve the shape recovery rate. Fourth, the SMA actuator, the recovery SMA strip, and a flexure sensor are inserted into a 3D printed mold which is filled with silicon rubber materials. The flexure sensor feeds back the finger shape for precise control. Fifth, a demolding process yields a fully integrated multifunctional soft robotic finger. We also fabricated a hand assembled with five fingers and a palm. We measured its performance and specifications with experiments. We demonstrated its capability of grasping various kinds of regular or irregular objects. The soft robotic hand is very robust and has a large compliance, which makes it ideal for use in an unstructured environment. It is inherently safe to human operators as it can withstand large impacts and unintended contacts without causing any injury to human operators or damage to the environment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report on a new technology used to implement strain sensors to be integrated in usual garments. A particular conductive mixture based on commercial products is realized and directly spread over a piece of fabric, which shows, after the treatment, piezoresistive properties, i.e., a change in resistance when it is strained. This property is exploited to realize sensorized garments such as gloves, leotards, and seat covers capable of reconstructing and monitoring body shape, posture, and gesture. In general, this technology is a good candidate for adherent wearable systems with excellent mechanical coupling with body surface. Here, we mainly focused on a sensorized glove able to detect posture and movements of the fingers. It could be used in several fields of application. We report on experimental results of a sensorized glove used as movements recorder for rehabilitation therapies and medicine. Furthermore, we describe a dedicated methodology used to read the output sensors which allowed to avoid using metallic wires for the connections. The price to be paid for all these advantages is a nonlinear electric response of the fabric sensor and a too long settling time, that in principle, make these sensors not suitable for real-time applications. Here we propose a hardware and computational solution to overcome this limitation.},

abstract = {Robot warehouse automation has attracted significant interest in recent years, perhaps most visibly in the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC). A fully autonomous warehouse pick-and-place system requires robust vision that reliably recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions, sensor noise, and a large variety of objects. In this paper we present an approach that leverages multi-view RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3rd- and 4th- place in the stowing and picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network, and then fit pre-scanned 3D object models to the resulting segmentation to get the 6D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation. We demonstrate that our system can reliably estimate the 6D pose of objects under a variety of scenarios. All code, data, and benchmarks are available at http://www.andyzeng.com/apc2016},

abstract = {This manuscript describes a unique class of locomotive robot: A soft robot, composed exclusively of soft materials (elastomeric polymers), which is inspired by animals (e.g., squid, starfish, worms) that do not have hard internal skeletons. Soft lithography was used to fabricate a pneumatically actuated robot capable of sophisticated locomotion (e.g., fluid movement of limbs and multiple gaits). This robot is quadrupedal; it uses no sensors, only five actuators, and a simple pneumatic valving system that operates at low pressures ({\textless} 10 psi). A combination of crawling and undulation gaits allowed this robot to navigate a difficult obstacle. This demonstration illustrates an advantage of soft robotics: They are systems in which simple types of actuation produce complex motion.},

abstract = {Conventional pneumatic actuators have been a popular choice due to their decent force/torque output. Nowadays, new generation of pneumatic actuator made out of highly compliant elastomers, which we call soft pneumatic actuators (SPA), are drawing increasing attention due to their ease of fabrication, high customizability and innately softness. However, there is no effective method presented to characterize and understand these actuators, such as to measure the force and torque output, range of motion and the speed of actuation. In this work, we present two types of SPAs: bending and rotary actuators. In addition, we have developed two measurement setups to characterize actuators of different geometries. The measured force/torque outputs of different actuators are presented and analyzed. Step responses to certain pressure input are presented and discussed. A simple model is presented to provide physical insight to the observed behavior of the soft actuators. This work provides the basis for designing customized SPAs with application-specific requirements.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the impact of assisted motor training in a virtual environment on hand function in stroke survivors. Participants: Fifteen volunteer stroke survivors (32–88 years old) with chronic upper extremity hemiparesis (1–38 years post incident) took part. Method: Participants had 6 weeks of training in reach-to-grasp of virtual and actual objects. They were randomized to one of three groups: assistance of digit extension provided by a novel cable orthosis, assistance provided by a novel pneumatic orthosis, or no assistance provided. Hand performance was evaluated at baseline, immediately following training, and 1 month after completion of training. Clinical assessments included the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Box and Blocks Test (BB), Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Test (FM), and Rancho Los Amigos Functional Test of the Hemiparetic Upper Extremity (RLA). Biomechanical assessments included grip strength, extension range of motion and velocity, spasticity, and isometric strength. Results: Participants demonstrated a significant decrease in time to perform functional tasks for the WMFT ( p = .02), an increase in the number of blocks successfully grasped and released during the BB ( p = .09), and an increase for the FM score ( p = .08). There were no statistically significant changes in time to complete tasks on the RLA or any of the biomechanical measures. Assistance of extension did not have a significant effect. Discussion and Conclusion: After the training period, participants in all 3 groups demonstrated a decrease in time to perform some of the functional tasks. Although the overall gains were slight, the general acceptance of the novel rehabilitation tools by a population with substantial impairment suggests that a larger randomized controlled trial, potentially in a subacute population, may be warranted.},

abstract = {The pressure sensor is a key device in many mechatronic systems for automotive and industrial applications. We represent the piezoresitive pressure sensor based on the single crystal silicon strain gauges, which are glass-fused to the stainless steel diaphragm at high temperature. The silicon bulkmicromachined strain gauges have the through holes and the closed structure, unlike the current competitive devices with open structure. This unique design concept reduces shifting or rotation of gauge position during glass frit bonding and enables the automation of alignment and bonding processes, which improves the sensor performance and yield and hence reduces sensor cost. The prototype was characterized using specific long term tests such as PPTCB (pulsed pressure, temperature cycling, with bias). The pressure sensors tested under pressure ranging from 0 to 50 bar at different temperature have a linear output with a typical sensitivity of about 16mV/V/bar and an offset drift of -6 mV to 2 mV. The fatigue life tests run at a rate of 3 Hz up to 2 million pressure cycles from 0 to 50 bar showed no failures when the pressure cycle test was stopped. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

This system features a multi-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion assistance robot, a VR interface for patients, and a symmetrical master-slave motion assistance training strategy called "self-motion control," in which the stroke patient's healthy hand on the master side creates the assistance motion for the impaired hand on the slave side. To assist in performing the fine exercise motions needed for functional recovery of the impaired hand, the robot was constructed in an exoskeleton with 18 DOFs, to assist finger and thumb independent motions such as flexion/extension and abduction/adduction, thumb opposability, and hand-wrist co- ordinated motions. To enhance the effectiveness of the exercises, audio-visual instructions of each training motion using VR technology were designed with the input of clinician researchers. Experimental results from healthy subjects and patients show sufficient performance in the range of motion of the robot as well as sufficient assistance forces.},

Then, we propose a novel observer based control methodology where the observer is built by Finite Element Model in this paper to deal with the control problem of soft robots. A closed-loop controller for position control of soft robot is designed based on the discrete-time model with feedback signal being extracted by means of visual servoing.

This method was shown to be capable of sequential folding, angle-controlled folds, slot-and-tab assembly, and mountain and valley folds. An inchworm robot was designed to demonstrate the merits of this technique. Upon the application of sufficient current, the robot was able to fold into its functional form with fold angle deviations within six degrees.

abstract = {Trajectory tracking control for quadrotors is important for applications ranging from surveying and inspection, to film making. However, designing and tuning classical controllers, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, to achieve high tracking precision can be time-consuming and difficult, due to hidden dynamics and other non-idealities. The Deep Neural Network (DNN), with its superior capability of approximating abstract, nonlinear functions, proposes a novel approach for enhancing trajectory tracking control. This paper presents a DNN-based algorithm that improves the tracking performance of a classical feedback controller. Given a desired trajectory, the DNNs provide a tailored input to the controller based on their gained experience. The input aims to achieve a unity map between the desired and the output trajectory. The motivation for this work is an interactive "fly-as-you-draw" application, in which a user draws a trajectory on a mobile device, and a quadrotor instantly flies that trajectory with the DNN-enhanced control system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the tracking precision for user-drawn trajectories after the DNNs are trained on selected periodic trajectories, suggesting the method's potential in real-world applications. Tracking errors are reduced by around 40-50 {\%} for both training and testing trajectories from users, highlighting the DNNs' capability of generalizing knowledge.},

abstract = {This thesis presents a new class of biologically inspired robots: continuum robotic surfaces. This work is fueled by the question: can the interaction between robot and environment be advanced with "programmable surfaces in space?" The novelty of continuum robotic surfaces lies in their ability to be actively controlled and reconfigured in what we believe is the current "missing dimension" in robot movements--two-dimensional space. We believe that such surfaces will lend themselves to more complex applications. However, to effectively deploy such surfaces for these complex applications, kinematic models will be necessary to plan and control desired configurations. The forward kinematic models for continuum surfaces introduced herein are an initial step in achieving this goal. Then, to test the precision of our model, we validate it via hardware realizations. Lastly, with the kinematic model and hardware realization, the next step is to explore one of the aforementioned complex applications for these surfaces. We believe that a continuum robotic surface can lend itself to upper-extremity stroke rehabilitation in a novel way. Our efforts in interactively designing and building a working prototype with the clinical and staff healthcare subject matter experts at the Roger C. Peace Rehabilitation Center of the Greenville Hospital System are detailed.},

abstract = {Providing robots with the capability of sensing their surrounding environment is an important feature that would lead to a more intuitive and safe physical human-robot interaction. This paper proposes a new design of homogeneous flexible and stretchable robot skin based on carbon-black-filled (CBF) silicone and conductive fabric that can sense multiple contact locations as well as applied pressure. CBF silicone has been already used in sensing technology but its piezoresistivity is still largely misunderstood. This particular behavior is investigated in this paper through a set of experiments conducted on isolated sensing cells. Using the results of these experiments, a model describing the variation of the resistivity in the CBF silicone as a function of the applied pressure is proposed. Based on this model, a simple way to accurately estimate the applied pressure in real time is demonstrated. Finally, using this improved knowledge of the behaviour of the CBF silicone, the fabrication of a fully functional sensor array is presented. The proposed design has the particularity of circumventing the well-known problem of cross-talk between sensing cells.},

@article{Lepora2017,
abstract = {—A key unsolved problem in tactile robotics is how to combine tactile perception and control to interact robustly and intelligently with the surroundings. Here we focus on a prototypical task of tactile exploration over surface features such as edges or ridges, which is a principal exploratory procedure of humans to recognize object shape. Our methods were adapted from an approach for biomimetic active touch that perceives stimulus location and identity while controlling location to aid perception. With minor modification to the control policy, to rotate the sensor to maintain a relative orientation and move tangentially (tactile servoing), the method applies also to tactile exploration. Robust exploratory tactile servoing is then attained over various 2D objects, ranging from the edge of a circular disk, a volute laminar, and circular or spiral ridges. Conceptu-ally, the approach brings together active perception and haptic exploration as instantiations of a common active touch algorithm, and has potential to generalize to more complex tasks requiring the flexibility and robustness of human touch.},

@article{Daum2003,
abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on selected XML technologies from the areas of design, data storage, middleware, authoring, and content management where practical solutions are already in place. Although, sometimes paper and pencil are the best design tools, there are cases where the help of computer-based tools is appreciated. Good design tools for XML-centric conceptual design are still as rare as hen's teeth. Among general design methods and design tools, UML is the obvious choice. Commercial systems such as Rational Rose and Together Soft also support the design of XML schemata. Directly generating XML from a conceptual model defined in UML is still an open problem. Processes can be defined with UML in the form of activity diagrams as well. Modeling processes for electronic business is usually not an isolated activity, so the modeling tools are usually integrated into the middleware product that supports a specific electronic business standard. For XML schema, the use of visual design tools is highly recommended because they considerably shorten the learning curve for this complex standard. The simplest way to store an XML file is in a native file system. In short, for enterprise solutions there is no other option than to store XML documents in a database management system.},

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {In this paper we introduce a shoe-integrated system for human abnormal gait detection. This intelligent system focuses on detecting the following patterns: normal gait, toe in, toe out, oversupination, and heel walking gait abnormalities. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of three-dimensional gyroscopes and accelerometers is employed to measure angular velocities and accelerations of the foot. Four force sensing resistors (FSRs) and one bend sensor are installed on the insole of each foot for force and flexion information acquisition. The proposed detection method is mainly based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature generation and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for multi-pattern classification. In the present study, four subjects tested the shoe-integrated device in outdoor environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust and efficient in detecting abnormal gait patterns. Our goal is to provide a cost-effective system for detecting gait abnormalities in order to assist persons with abnormal gaits in the developing of a normal walking pattern in their daily life.},

Synthesized with control barrier functions, the certificates are used to modify the nominal trajectory in a minimally invasive way to avoid collisions. The proposed collision avoidance strategy complements existing flight control and planning algorithms by providing trajectory modifications with provable safety guarantees. The effectiveness of this strategy is supported both by the theoretical results and experimental validation on a team of five quadrotors.},
