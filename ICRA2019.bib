abstract = { Abstract Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are found in mobile robots, assistive wearable devices, and rehabilitative technologies. While soft actuators have been one of the most crucial elements of technology leading the development of the soft robotics field, they fall short of force output and bandwidth requirements for many tasks. In addition, other general problems remain open, including robustness, controllability, and repeatability. The SPA-pack architecture presented here aims to satisfy these standards of reliability crucial to the field of soft robotics, while also improving the basic performance capabilities of SPAs by borrowing advantages leveraged ubiquitously in biology; namely, the structured parallel arrangement of lower power actuators to form the basis of a larger and more powerful actuator module. An SPA-pack module consisting of a number of smaller SPAs will be studied using an analytical model and physical prototype. Experimental measurements show an SPA pack to generate over 112 N linear force, while the model indicates the benefit of parallel actuator grouping over a geometrically equivalent single SPA scale as an increasing function of the number of individual actuators in the group. For a module of four actuators, a 23{\%} increase in force production over a volumetrically equivalent single SPA is predicted and validated, while further gains appear possible up to 50{\%}. These findings affirm the advantage of utilizing a fascicle structure for high-performance soft robotic applications over existing monolithic SPA designs. An example of high-performance soft robotic platform will be presented to demonstrate the capability of SPA-pack modules in a complete and functional system. },

abstract = {The proliferation of soft robotics research worldwide has brought substantial achievements in terms of principles, models, technologies, techniques, and prototypes of soft robots. Such achievements are reviewed here in terms of the abilities that they provide robots that were not possible before. An analysis of the evolution of this field shows how, after a few pioneering works in the years 2009 to 2012, breakthrough results were obtained by taking seminal tech-nological and scientific challenges related to soft robotics from actuation and sensing to modeling and control. Further progress in soft robotics research has produced achievements that are important in terms of robot abilities—that is, from the viewpoint of what robots can do today thanks to the soft robotics approach. Abilities such as squeezing, stretching, climbing, growing, and morphing would not be possible with an approach based only on rigid links. The challenge ahead for soft robotics is to further develop the abilities for robots to grow, evolve, self-heal, develop, and biodegrade, which are the ways that robots can adapt their morphology to the environment.},

abstract = {We describe the design and control of a wearable robotic device powered by pneumatic artificial muscle actuators for use in ankle-foot rehabilitation. The design is inspired by the biological musculoskeletal system of the human foot and lower leg, mimicking the morphology and the functionality of the biological muscle-tendon-ligament structure. A key feature of the device is its soft structure that provides active assistance without restricting natural degrees of freedom at the ankle joint. Four pneumatic artificial muscles assist dorsiflexion and plantarflexion as well as inversion and eversion. The prototype is also equipped with various embedded sensors for gait pattern analysis. For the subject tested, the prototype is capable of generating an ankle range of motion of 27° (14° dorsiflexion and 13° plantarflexion). The controllability of the system is experimentally demonstrated using a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller. The controller is found using an identified LTI model of the system, resulting from the interaction of the soft orthotic device with a human leg, and model-based classical control design techniques. The suitability of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated with several angle-reference following experiments.},

These wearable extra fingers can work together with the human fingers and perform tasks that are usually difficult for a single hand. Such technology may benefit amputees and surviving stroke patients who are forced to live with only one functional arm. In this paper, we present a novel method, exploiting redundancies in the elbow, to control a pair of extra robotic fingers, termed Supernumerary Robotic Fingers or SR Fingers for short, to perform {\&}{\#}x201C;hold-and-manipulate{\&}{\#}x201D; tasks. Two control protocols are explored here. One protocol enables discrete transition between different modes of motion, while the other continuously controls grasping behavior of the SR Fingers. Four robot assisted {\&}{\#}x201C;hold-and-manipulate{\&}{\#}x201D; tasks are examined, including twisting off the cap of a water bottle, opening the lid of a food container, plugging a cable into an electronic device, and mixing salad in a bowl. Through the successful completion of these tasks, we demonstrate that wearable extra fingers have the potential to provide those with impaired hands the opportunity to live with more independence and work more productively.},

abstract = {Aim: To estimate the prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) and the frequency of co-occurring developmental disabilities (DDs), gross motor function (GMF), and walking ability using the largest surveillance DD database in the US. Methods: We conducted population-based surveillance of 8-year-old children in 2006 (N= 142,338), in areas of Alabama, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Missouri. This multi-site collaboration involved retrospective record review at multiple sources. We reported CP subtype, co-occurring DDs, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, and walking ability as well as CP period prevalence by race/ethnicity and sex. Results: CP prevalence was 3.3 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 3.1-3.7) per 1000 and varied by site, ranging from 2.9 (Wisconsin) to 3.8 (Georgia) per 1000, 8-year olds (p{\textless} 0.02). Approximately 81{\%} had spastic CP. Among children with CP, 8{\%} had an autism spectrum disorder and 35{\%} had epilepsy. Using the GMFCS, 38.1{\%} functioned at the highest level (I), with 17.1{\%} at the lowest level (V). Fifty-six percent were able to walk independently and 33{\%} had limited or no walking ability. Interpretation: Surveillance data are enhanced when factors such as functioning and co-occurring conditions known to affect clinical service needs, quality of life, and health care are also considered. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a robotic manipulation system capable of autonomously positioning a multi-segment soft fluidic elastomer robot in three dimensions. Specifically, we present an extremely soft robotic manipulator morphology that is composed entirely from low durometer elastomer, powered by pressurized air, and designed to be both modular and durable. To understand the deformation of a single arm segment, we develop and experimentally validate a static deformation model. Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot's spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator's configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

abstract = {Soft robotics is a challenging and promising branch of robotics. It can drive significant improvements across various fields of traditional robotics, and contribute solutions to basic problems such as locomotion and manipulation in unstructured environments. A challenging task for soft robotics is to build and control soft robots able to exert effective forces. In recent years, biology has inspired several solutions to such complex problems. This study aims at investigating the smart solution that the Octopus vulgaris adopts to perform a crawling movement, with the same limbs used for grasping and manipulation. An ad hoc robot was designed and built taking as a reference a biological hypothesis on crawling. A silicone arm with cables embedded to replicate the functionality of the arm muscles of the octopus was built. This novel arm is capable of pushing-based locomotion and object grasping, mimicking the movements that octopuses adopt when crawling. The results support the biological observations and clearly show a suitable way to build a more complex soft robot that, with minimum control, can perform diverse tasks.},

@article{nguyen2017,
abstract = {The necessity for efficient control of soft actuators has recently resulted in the development of complex physical models that are actuator geometry and material type dependent. In this paper, we address the ability to do closed-loop control with a simplified model independent of material properties and material characteristics of a soft robotic system. We demonstrate this by using a P-controller on a new 3-chambered, fiber-reinforced elastomeric actuator (3CA) that utilizes off-the-shelf stretch sensors. A motion capture system is used to calibrate and generate two different quasi-static models (a general linear regression model and an input dependent model) that map the varying chamber pressure readings with the actuator's end effector position, effectively represented by the stretch sensor curvature. Simulations using a closed-loop controller, with both models, provide further insight on the quality of the models and corresponding control performance. We use this information in an experimental study that yields comparable performances to the simulated results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input-dependent model based controller can provide better results than that of the general model based controller. Finally, we demonstrate that our soft actuator can be closed-loop controlled with off-the-shelf stretch sensors with repeatable results. This opens a way to design new control concepts for multi-chambered actuators that can produce more complex motions in the future.},

abstract = {A new type of wearable robot that assists the wearer with extra arms secured around the hips is presented. Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.},

abstract = {We present the inverse pneumatic artificial muscle (IPAM), a new soft actuator that is powered by pneumatics in a manner inverse to traditional pneumatic muscles: low pressure, rather than high, contracts the muscle. The IPAM improves on the 50-year-old standard in soft pneumatic actuators, the McKibben muscle, but retains many of the advantages that have drawn roboticists to this artificial muscle over the years. The McKibben muscle produces up to 40{\%} strain, and has nonlinear control with friction and hysteresis, whereas the IPAM attains strains of over 300{\%} and has a nearly linear mapping between input pressure and force/length output and no sliding friction. Crucially, the IPAM retains the soft structure, low weight, compliance, and robustness that the McKibben muscle boasts. We present a simple model to describe the behavior of the muscle, as well as force, displacement, pressure, and speed tests validating the model and characterizing the IPAM's performance. Further, we present two practical implementations using the IPAM: an active brace and a robotic finger.},

The resulting data-driven properties are then used to predict the grasp strengths and motion patterns of SR grasp-assist device configurations designed to accommodate the manipulation of daily living objects. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to program grasp synergies into SR fingers by strategic inflation of the bending actuator antagonist chambers (varying mechanical stiffness), without the need for complicated, high-power mechanisms or precise, low-level motion control. The results also demonstrate the underactuated grasp adaptations enabled by modular inflatable components and the ability to predict mechanical grasping capabilities of wearable pneumatic SR grasp-assist devices using insights from empirical data.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review recent developments in exoskeletons and robotic prosthetics.Design/methodology/approach – This paper first describes a number of recently developed exoskeletons for military, civil and medical applications. It then discusses robotic prosthetics and concludes with a brief consideration of progress in brain‐computer interface (BCI) technology.Findings – Robotic exoskeletons are the topic of a major research effort, much being funded by the US military, and aims to impart superhuman strength to the wearer. Japanese research is also well advanced and concerns a range of non‐military applications, including strength enhancement and medical rehabilitation. Some products have recently been commercialised. There has also been significant progress in the development of robotic prosthetic limbs, a topic which is also attracting support from the US military. A key aim is the development of thought‐controlled prosthetics which will arise from advances in BCI technology.Originality/value – This paper provides a detailed review of the latest developments in exoskeletons and robotic prosthetics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to balance assistance and joint load reduction for human bipedal walking. We introduce a new type of wearable robot, called Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), that provides two additional legs for augmenting stability and reducing the loads on human leg joints. Unlike exoskeletons, the SRL is kinematically independent of the human skeletal structure, and can therefore take an arbitrary posture to provide optimal assistance in coordination with human motions. Furthermore, unlike crutches, canes, and other balance assistance equipment, the SRL can provide balancing support autonomously and thereby free the human arms from holding those tools. First, the new design concept and balance assistance strategy are described, followed by kinematic and static modeling. Two gate patterns of the combined human and SRL are discussed. Optimal gate synthesis that maximizes the area of support polygon is discussed. Finally, the gate control strategies are implemented on a prototype SRL, using body motion sensors to enable real-time, seamless coordination between the user and the robot.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the combination of our soft supernumerary robotic finger i.e. Soft-SixthFinger with a commercially available zero gravity arm support, the SaeboMAS. The overall proposed system can provide the needed assistance during paretic upper limb rehabilitation involving both grasping and arm mobility to solve task-oriented activities. The Soft-SixthFinger is a wearable robotic supernumerary finger designed to be used as an active assistive device by post stroke patients to compensate the paretic hand grasp. The device works jointly with the paretic hand/arm to grasp an object similarly to the two parts of a robotic gripper. The SaeboMAS is a commercially available mobile arm support to neutralize gravity effects on the paretic arm specifically designed to facilitate and challenge the weakened shoulder muscles during functional tasks. The proposed system has been designed to be used during the rehabilitation phase when the arm is potentially able to recover its functionality, but the hand is still not able to perform a grasp due to the lack of an efficient thumb opposition. The overall system also act as a motivation tool for the patients to perform task-oriented rehabilitation activities. With the aid of proposed system, the patient can closely simulate the desired motion with the non-functional arm for rehabilitation purposes, while performing a grasp with the help of the Soft-SixthFinger. As a pilot study we tested the proposed system with a chronic stroke patient to evaluate how the mobile arm support in conjunction with a robotic supernumerary finger can help in performing the tasks requiring the manipulation of grasped object through the paretic arm. In particular, we performed the Frenchay Arm Test (FAT) and Box and Block Test (BBT). The proposed system successfully enabled the patient to complete tasks which were previously impossible to perform.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our recent results in the development of a new class of soft, continuous backbone (“continuum”) robot manipulators. Our work is strongly motivated by the dexterous appendages found in cephalopods, particularly the arms and suckers of octopus, and the arms and tentacles of squid. Our ongoing investigation of these animals reveals interesting and unexpected functional aspects of their structure and behavior. The arrangement and dynamic operation of muscles and connective tissue observed in the arms of a variety of octopus species motivate the underlying design approach for our soft manipulators. These artificial manipulators feature biomimetic actuators, including artificial muscles based on both electro-active polymers (EAP) and pneumatic (McKibben) muscles. They feature a “clean” continuous backbone design, redundant degrees of freedom, and exhibit significant compliance that provides novel operational capacities during environmental interaction and object manipulation. The unusual compliance and redundant degrees of freedom provide strong potential for application to delicate tasks in cluttered and/or unstructured environments. Our aim is to endow these compliant robotic mechanisms with the diverse and dexterous grasping behavior observed in octopuses. To this end, we are conducting fundamental research into the manipulation tactics, sensory biology, and neural control of octopuses. This work in turn leads to novel approaches to motion planning and operator interfaces for the robots. The paper describes the above efforts, along with the results of our development of a series of continuum tentacle-like robots, demonstrating the unique abilities of biologically-inspired design.},

Soft actuators comprised of elastomeric materials with integrated channels that function as pneumatic networks (PneuNets), are designed and geometrically analyzed to produce bending motions that can safely conform with the human finger motion. Bending curvature and force response of these actuators are investigated using geometrical analysis and a finite element model (FEM) prior to fabrication. The fabrication procedure of the chosen actuator is described followed by a series of experiments that mechanically characterize the actuators. The experimental data is compared to results obtained from FEM simulations showing good agreement.

Dependent on the specific design, all of these materials may result in extrinsically soft robots. Organic elastomers, however, have elastic moduli ranging from tens of megapascals down to kilopascals; robots composed of such materials are intrinsically soft − they are always compliant independent of their shape. This class of soft machines has been used to reduce control complexity and manufacturing cost of robots, while enabling sophisticated and novel functionalities often in direct contact with humans.

Such technology will have applications in manufacturing and construction, as well as health care. This paper presents a method for controlling extra robotic fingers, termed “Supernumerary Robotic Fingers (SR Fingers),” in coordination with human fingers to grasp diverse objects. Two hypotheses are proposed and verified through experiments. One is that humans prefer grasp posture of their fingers and that of the SR Fingers to be highly correlated when working together, which is represented with a few principal components, resembling grasp synergy in neuromotor control. The other hypothesis is that SR Finger posture can be controlled to coordinate with human finger posture via grasp synergy of the hybrid human–robotic hand. Partial least squares regression is used for predicting a desired posture of the SR Fingers from the measurement of human fingers. This method is implemented on a pair of wrist-mounted SR Fingers. Experiments demonstrate that the prototype SR Fingers can assist the human user in performing single-handed grasping tasks without requiring explicit commands.},

A third arm helping us out with the weekly shopping in the local grocery store, or an extra artificial limb assisting a paralysed person? Here we report a perceptual illusion in which a rubber right hand, placed beside the real hand in full view of the participant, is perceived as a supernumerary limb belonging to the participant's own body. This effect was supported by questionnaire data in conjunction with physiological evidence obtained from skin conductance responses when physically threatening either the rubber hand or the real one. In four well-controlled experiments, we demonstrate the minimal required conditions for the elicitation of this “supernumerary hand illusion”. In the fifth, and final experiment, we show that the illusion reported here is qualitatively different from the traditional rubber hand illusion as it is characterised by less disownership of the real hand and a stronger feeling of having two right hands. These results suggest that the artificial hand ‘borrows' some of the multisensory processes that represent the real hand, leading to duplication of touch and ownership of two right arms. This work represents a major advance because it challenges the traditional view of the gross morphology of the human body as a fundamental constraint on what we can come to experience as our physical self, by showing that the body representation can easily be updated to incorporate an additional limb.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a novel multi-section, continuous-backbone ("continuum") robot. The design is based on an innovative "hose-in-hose" concept. Its implementation is novel with respect to previous continuum robot designs in that stiffness and extension, in addition to bending, are actively controlled in each section of the robot. This requires a non-trivial extension of previously proposed kinematic models, and poses challenges for real-time control of the robot. We introduce a tangling/untangling algorithm to map between overall cable lengths and per-section cable lengths. Details of the design and its implementation are presented, along with a summary of real-time control issues and experimental results.},

abstract = {—A novel solution to compensate hand grasping abil-ities is proposed for chronic post-stroke patients. The idea is to provide the patients with a wearable robotic extra-finger that can be worn on the paretic forearm by means of an elastic band. The proposed prototype, the Robotic Sixth-Finger, is a modular articulated device that can adapt its structure to the grasped object shape and vary its joint stiffness to tight the obtained grasp when needed. The extra-finger and the paretic hand act like the two parts of a gripper working together to hold an object. We evaluated the feasibility of the approach with with two chronic stroke patients performing a qualitative test, the Franchay Arm Test. In this proof of concept study, the use of the robotic extra-finger has increased the total score of both patients of 2 points in a 5 points scale. Practically, the subjects were able to perform the two grasping tasks included in the test that were not possible without the robotic extra-finger . Adding a robotic opposing finger is a very promising approach that can significantly improve the functional recovery of the chronic stroke patient during everyday life activities.},

abstract = {Soft actuators comprised of fluidic structures with fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures are seen throughout nature, exhibiting strength, power density, resilience, and diverse motions and forces.However, these structures are rarely used by engineers, in part due to the absence of a generalized understanding of their kinematics and forces. A small subset of soft actuators generating only extension or compression, popularly known as McKibben ac- tuators, has been thoroughly investigated. This paper introduces the entire design space of actuators built with two families of fibers, of whichMcKibben actuators occupy a subset. The helix angle of the actuator's translation and rotation deformation is determined from the kinematics of the fiber deformation for all fiber angles as the actuator is pressurized. The volumetric transduction of the ac- tuators, relating the output motion to change in contained volume, is analytically determined. The results are discretized to provide a designer with an easy to use design selection chart.The kinematics, force, and moment of the actuators are experimentally validated for all fiber angles.

abstract = {Paralysis following spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other disorders can disconnect the brain from the body, eliminating the ability to perform volitional movements. A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

It solves the singularity problems associated with previous models and introduces a novel approach for intuitively deriving exact, singularity-free MSFs, thus avoiding mode switching schemes and simplifying error models. The model is able to simulate spatial bending, pure elongation/contraction, and introduces inverse orientation kinematics for the first time to multisection continuum arms. Also, it carefully accounts for physical constraints in the joint space to provide enhanced insight into practical mechanics, and produces correct results for both forward and inverse kinematics. The model is validated through simulations, based on a prototype continuum robotic arm. Proposed approach is applicable to a broad spectrum of continuum robotic arm designs.},

The hypothesis that multisensory integration is both a necessary and sufficient condition for body ownership is debated. We systematically varied the appearance of the object that was stimulated in synchrony or asynchrony with the participant's hand. A viewed object that was transformed in three stages from a plain wooden block to a wooden hand was compared to a realistic rubber hand. Introspective and behavioural results show that participants experience a sense of ownership only for the realistic prosthetic hand, suggesting that not all objects can be experienced as part of one's body. Instead, the viewed object must fit with a reference model of the body that contains important structural information about body parts. This body model can distinguish between corporeal and non-corporeal objects, and it therefore plays a critical role in maintaining a coherent sense of one's body.},

abstract = {t raditional rigid robots, such as those used in manufacturing, have been effective at precise, accurate, rapid motions in well-structured environments for many decades now. However, they operate largely behind cages due to the danger of injury when moving in close proximity to people. A significant and recent shift in robotics involves trading rigid links and rigid actuators for soft, deformable links and compliant actuators. These soft robots generally have lower inertia and avoid many of the problems caused by the high effective inertia resulting from the high gear ratios necessary for rigid robots. This shift to soft robots will allow robots to safely operate in close proximity to humans. The design of such soft robots, which has been a major emphasis in research, does not com-pletely enable soft robots to effectively perform tasks. The focus of this article is the development of dynamic models and control methods to allow multiple-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) soft robots to perform useful tasks. We present results on fully inflatable, pneumatically actuated soft robot plat-forms that include a 14-DoF humanoid robot. The Benefits of Soft Robots There has been significant interest in making robots more effective at interacting with humans and operating in human environments. Robots currently have limited uses in homes, hospitals, schools, or other areas where safe interaction with people or the environment may be necessary. One reason why robots are not common in these places is because traditional robots can be dangerous to people or property when there is incidental contact. Benefits from soft robot platforms such as the one for con-trol development that we describe in this article include the fact that the compliance comes from passive elements (air) instead of requiring active sensors and controllers for added safety. In addition, we control the robot at fairly low pressures, including 6.9–13.8 kPa (1–2 lbf/in 2) gauge in the main body chamber and 172.4 kPa (25 lbf/in 2) gauge in the actuation bladders. In comparison, these pressures are less than a bike tire, where pressures range from 206.8 to 896.3 kPa (30–130 lbf/in 2). This means there is lower risk of injury when there is failure such as bursting or leaking of air. In addition to compliance, lightweight robots, such as the platform for which},

abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot's Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

abstract = {Different approaches are available to compensate gait in persons with spinal cord injury, including passive orthoses, functional electrical stimulation (FES), and robotic exoskeletons. However, several drawbacks arise from each specific approach. Orthotic gait is energy-demanding for the user and functionally ineffective. FES uses the muscles as natural actuators to generate gait, providing not only functional but also psychological benefits to the users. However, disadvantages are also related to the early appearance of muscle fatigue and the control of joint trajectories. Robotic exoskeletons that provide joint moment compensation or substitution to the body during walking have been developed in recent years. Significant advances have been achieved, but the technology itself is not mature yet because of many limitations related to both physical and cognitive interaction as well as portability and energy-management issues. Meanwhile, the combination of FES technology and exoskeletons has emerged as a promising approach to both gait compensation and rehabilitation, bringing together technologies, methods, and rehabilitation principles that can overcome the drawbacks of each individual approach. This article presents an overview of hybrid lower-limb exoskeletons, related technologies, and advances in actuation and control systems. Also, we highlight the functional assessment of individuals with spinal cord injury.},

In industry, there is a growing demand for safe industrial robots to collaborate with people and work in various environments.

abstract = {Mice are one of the most commonly used laboratory animals, with an extensive array of disease models in existence, including for many neuromuscular diseases. The hindlimb is of particular interest due to several close muscle analogues/homologues to humans and other species. A detailed anatomical study describing the adult morphology is lacking, however. This study describes in detail the musculoskeletal geometry and skeletal muscle architecture of the mouse hindlimb and pelvis, determining the extent to which the muscles are adapted for their function, as inferred from their architecture. Using I2KI enhanced microCT scanning and digital segmentation, it was possible to identify 39 distinct muscles of the hindlimb and pelvis belonging to nine functional groups. The architecture of each of these muscles was determined through microdissections, revealing strong architectural specialisations between the functional groups. The hip extensors and hip adductors showed significantly stronger adaptations towards high contraction velocities and joint control relative to the distal functional groups, which exhibited larger physiological cross sectional areas and longer tendons, adaptations for high force output and elastic energy savings. These results suggest that a proximo-distal gradient in muscle architecture exists in the mouse hindlimb. Such a gradient has been purported to function in aiding locomotor stability and efficiency. The data presented here will be especially valuable to any research with a focus on the architecture or gross anatomy of the mouse hindlimb and pelvis musculature, but also of use to anyone interested in the functional significance of muscle design in relation to quadrupedal locomotion.},

abstract = {Abstract Soft robot arms possess unique capabilities when it comes to adaptability, flexibility, and dexterity. In addition, soft systems that are pneumatically actuated can claim high power-to-weight ratio. One of the main drawbacks of pneumatically actuated soft arms is that their stiffness cannot be varied independently from their end-effector position in space. The novel robot arm physical design presented in this article successfully decouples its end-effector positioning from its stiffness. An experimental characterization of this ability is coupled with a mathematical analysis. The arm combines the light weight, high payload to weight ratio and robustness of pneumatic actuation with the adaptability and versatility of variable stiffness. Light weight is a vital component of the inherent safety approach to physical human-robot interaction. To characterize the arm, a neural network analysis of the curvature of the arm for different input pressures is performed. The curvature-pressure relationship is also characterized experimentally.},

abstract = {Artificial muscles are flexible actuators with capabilities similar to, or even beyond, natural muscles. They have been widely used in many applications as alternatives to more traditional rigid electromagnetic motors. Numerous studies focus on rapid design and low-cost fabrication of artificial muscles with customized performances. Here, we present an architecture for fluidic artificial muscles with unprecedented performance-to-cost ratio. These artificial muscles can be programed to produce not only a single contraction but also complex multiaxial actuation, and even controllable motion with multiple degrees of freedom. Moreover, a wide variety of materials and fabrication processes can be used to build the artificial muscles with other functions beyond basic actuation.Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90{\%} of their initial lengths, generate stresses of {\~{}}600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg{\{}$\backslash$textemdash{\}}all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.},

Stroke is a clinical illness resulting in long lasting neurological deficits often affecting somatosensory and motor cortices. More than half of those that recover from a stroke survive with disability in their upper arm and need rehabilitation therapy to help in regaining functions of daily living. In this paper, we demonstrated a prototype of a low-cost, ultra-light and wearable soft robotic assistive device that could aid administration of elbow motion therapies to stroke patients. In order to assist the rotation of the elbow joint, the soft modules which consist of soft wedge-like cellular units was inflated by air to produce torque at the elbow joint. Highly compliant rotation can be naturally realised by the elastic property of soft silicone and pneumatic control of air. Based on the direct visual-actuation control, a higher control loop utilised visual processing to apply positional control, the lower control loop was implemented by an electronic circuit to achieve the desired pressure of the soft modules by Pulse Width Modulation. To examine the functionality of the proposed soft modular system, we used an anatomical model of the upper limb and performed the experiments with healthy participants.},

The simplest forms of Rivlin's strain energy function are the neo-Hookean, which is obtained by truncating the infinite series to just the first term in I1, and the Mooney-Rivlin, which retains the first terms in I1 and I2. Recently, we proposed a strain energy function which is a cubic in I1. Conceptually, the proposed function is a material model with a shear modulus that varies with deformation. In this paper, we compare the large strain behavior of rubber as predicted by these forms of the strain energy function. The elastic behavior of swollen rubber is also discussed.},

As our knowledge it is the first time to solve the kinematics of muti-joint soft inflatable arm in Three-Dimensional coordinate space. Numerous experiments have been conducted, including movement space and positioning accuracy. The workspace and velocity are close to an adult's arm movement space and normal motion speed.},

abstract = {Fluid-powered elastomeric soft robots have been shown to be able to generate complex output motion using a simple control input such as pressurization of a working fluid. This capability, which mimics similar functions often found in biology, results from variations in mechanical properties of the soft robotic body that cause it to strain to different degrees when stress is applied with the fluid. In this work, we outline a mechanics- and optimization-based approach that enables the automatic selection of mechanical properties of a fiber-reinforced soft actuator to match the kinematic trajectory of the fingers or thumb during a grasping operation. This methodology can be readily extended to other applications that require mimicking or assisting biological motions.Soft actuators are the components responsible for producing motion in soft robots. Although soft actuators have allowed for a variety of innovative applications, there is a need for design tools that can help to efficiently and systematically design actuators for particular functions. Mathematical modeling of soft actuators is an area that is still in its infancy but has the potential to provide quantitative insights into the response of the actuators. These insights can be used to guide actuator design, thus accelerating the design process. Here, we study fluid-powered fiber-reinforced actuators, because these have previously been shown to be capable of producing a wide range of motions. We present a design strategy that takes a kinematic trajectory as its input and uses analytical modeling based on nonlinear elasticity and optimization to identify the optimal design parameters for an actuator that will follow this trajectory upon pressurization. We experimentally verify our modeling approach, and finally we demonstrate how the strategy works, by designing actuators that replicate the motion of the index finger and thumb.},

abstract = {Manipulators based on soft robotic technologies exhibit compliance and dexterity which ensures safe human–robot interaction. This article is a novel attempt at exploiting these desirable properties to develop a manipulator for an assistive application, in particular, a shower arm to assist the elderly in the bathing task. The overall vision for the soft manipulator is to concatenate three modules in a serial manner such that (i) the proximal segment is made up of cable-based actuation to compensate for gravitational effects and (ii) the central and distal segments are made up of hybrid actuation to autonomously reach delicate body parts to perform the main tasks related to bathing. The role of the latter modules is crucial to the application of the system in the bathing task; however, it is a nontrivial challenge to develop a robust and controllable hybrid actuated system with advanced manipulation capabilities and hence, the focus of this article. We first introduce our design and experimentally characterize its functionalities, which include elongation, shortening, omnidirectional bending. Next, we propose a control concept capable of solving the inverse kinetics problem using multiagent reinforcement learning to exploit these functionalities despite high dimensionality and redundancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the design and control of this module by demonstrating an open-loop task space control where it successfully moves through an asymmetric 3-D trajectory sampled at 12 points with an average reaching accuracy of 0.79 cm ± 0.18 cm. Our quantitative experimental results present a promising step toward the development of the soft manipulator eventually contributing to the advancement of soft robotics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel spatial kinematic model for multisection continuum arms based on mode shape functions (MSF). Modal methods have been used in many disciplines from finite element methods to structural analysis to approximate complex and nonlinear parametric variations with simple mathematical functions. Given certain constraints and required accuracy, this helps to simplify complex phenomena with numerically efficient implementations leading to fast computations. A successful application of the modal approximation techniques to develop a new modal kinematic model for general variable length multisection continuum arms is discussed. The proposed method solves the limitations associated with previous models and introduces a new approach for readily deriving exact, singularity-free and unique MSF's that simplifies the approach and avoids mode switching. The model is able to simulate spatial bending as well as straight arm motions (i.e., pure elongation/contraction), and introduces inverse position and orientation kinematics for multisection continuum arms. A kinematic decoupling feature, splitting position and orientation inverse kinematics is introduced. This type of decoupling has not been presented for these types of robotic arms before. The model also carefully accounts for physical constraints in the joint space to provide enhanced insight into practical mechanics and impose actuator mechanical limitations onto the kinematics thus generating fully realizable results. The proposed method is easily applicable to a broad spectrum of continuum arm designs.},

abstract = {Background People with chronic tetraplegia, due to high-cervical spinal cord injury, can regain limb movements through coordinated electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles and nerves, known as functional electrical stimulation (FES). Users typically command FES systems through other preserved, but unrelated and limited in number, volitional movements (eg, facial muscle activity, head movements, shoulder shrugs). We report the findings of an individual with traumatic high-cervical spinal cord injury who coordinated reaching and grasping movements using his own paralysed arm and hand, reanimated through implanted FES, and commanded using his own cortical signals through an intracortical brain–computer interface (iBCI). Methods We recruited a participant into the BrainGate2 clinical trial, an ongoing study that obtains safety information regarding an intracortical neural interface device, and investigates the feasibility of people with tetraplegia controlling assistive devices using their cortical signals. Surgical procedures were performed at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). Study procedures and data analyses were performed at Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH, USA) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Cleveland, OH, USA). The study participant was a 53-year-old man with a spinal cord injury (cervical level 4, American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale category A). He received two intracortical microelectrode arrays in the hand area of his motor cortex, and 4 months and 9 months later received a total of 36 implanted percutaneous electrodes in his right upper and lower arm to electrically stimulate his hand, elbow, and shoulder muscles. The participant used a motorised mobile arm support for gravitational assistance and to provide humeral abduction and adduction under cortical control. We assessed the participant's ability to cortically command his paralysed arm to perform simple single-joint arm and hand movements and functionally meaningful multi-joint movements. We compared iBCI control of his paralysed arm with that of a virtual three-dimensional arm. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00912041. Findings The intracortical implant occurred on Dec 1, 2014, and we are continuing to study the participant. The last session included in this report was Nov 7, 2016. The point-to-point target acquisition sessions began on Oct 8, 2015 (311 days after implant). The participant successfully cortically commanded single-joint and coordinated multi-joint arm movements for point-to-point target acquisitions (80–100{\%} accuracy), using first a virtual arm and second his own arm animated by FES. Using his paralysed arm, the participant volitionally performed self-paced reaches to drink a mug of coffee (successfully completing 11 of 12 attempts within a single session 463 days after implant) and feed himself (717 days after implant). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first report of a combined implanted FES+iBCI neuroprosthesis for restoring both reaching and grasping movements to people with chronic tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury, and represents a major advance, with a clear translational path, for clinically viable neuroprostheses for restoration of reaching and grasping after paralysis.

abstract = {Abstract In this work we investigate the influence of fiber angle on the deformation of fiber-reinforced soft fluidic actuators and examine the manner in which these actuators extend axially, expand radially and twist about their axis as a function of input pressure. We study the quantitative relationship between fiber angle and actuator deformation by performing finite element simulations for actuators with a range of different fiber angles, and we verify the simulation results by experimentally characterizing the actuators. By combining actuator segments in series, we can achieve combinations of motions tailored to specific tasks. We demonstrate this by using the results of simulations of separate actuators to design a segmented wormlike soft robot capable of propelling itself through a tube and performing an orientation-specific peg insertion task at the end of the tube. Understanding the relationship between fiber angle and pressurization response of these soft fluidic actuators enables rapid exploration of the design space, opening the door to the iteration of exciting soft robot concepts such as flexible and compliant endoscopes, pipe inspection devices, and assembly line robots.},

abstract = {Wearable robotic devices have been shown to substantially reduce the energy expenditure of human walking. However, response variance between subjects for fixed control strategies can be high, leading to the hypothesis that individualized controllers could further improve walking economy. Recent studies on human-in-the-loop (HIL) control optimization have elucidated several practical challenges—in particular, long protocols and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here we show a method using Bayesian optimization—an algorithm well-suited to noisy signals with very limited data—to identify optimal peak and offset timing of hip extension assistance that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking with a textile-based wearable device. Optimal peak and offset timing were found over an average of 21.4 ± 1.0 min and reduced metabolic cost by 17.4 ± 3.2{\%} compared to walking without the device (mean ± s.e.m), which represented an improvement of more than 60{\%} on metabolic reduction compared to state-of-the-art devices only assisting hip extension. In addition, our results provide evidence for subject-specific metabolic distributions with respect to peak and offset timing, metabolic landscapes, lending support to the hypothesis that individualized control strategies can offer substantial benefits over fixed control strategies. These results also suggest that this method could have practical impact on improving the performance of wearable robotic devices.},

This pattern of movement is found in fungal hyphae, developing neurons, and trailing plants, and is characterized by extension from the tip of the body, length change of hundreds of percent, and active control of growth direction. This results in the abilities to move through tightly constrained environments and form useful three-dimensional structures from the body. We report a class of soft pneumatic robot that is capable of a basic form of this behavior, growing substantially in length from the tip while actively controlling direction using onboard sensing of environmental stimuli; further, the peak rate of lengthening is comparable to rates of animal and robot locomotion. This is enabled by two principles: Pressurization of an inverted thin-walled vessel allows rapid and substantial lengthening of the tip of the robot body, and controlled asymmetric lengthening of the tip allows directional control. Further, we demonstrate the abilities to lengthen through constrained environments by exploiting passive deformations and form three-dimensional structures by lengthening the body of the robot along a path. Our study helps lay the foundation for engineered systems that grow to navigate the environment.},

Conventional robots, although reliable and consistent, can cause injury to anyone within its range of motion. Soft robotics, wherein systems are made to be soft and mechanically compliant, are thus a promising alternative due to their lightweight nature and ability to cushion impacts, but current designs often sacrifice accuracy and usefulness for safety. We, therefore, have developed a bioinspired robotic arm combining elements of rigid and soft robotics such that it exhibits the positive qualities of both, namely compliance and accuracy, while maintaining a low weight. This article describes the design of a robotic arm–wrist–hand system with seven degrees of freedom (DOFs). The shoulder and elbow each has two DOFs for two perpendicular rotational motions on each joint, and the hand has two DOFs for wrist rotations and one DOF for a grasp motion. The arm is pneumatically powered using custom-built McKibben type pneumatic artificial muscles, which are inflated and deflated using binary and proportional valves. The wrist and hand motions are actuated through servomotors. In addition to the actuators, the arm is equipped with a potentiometer in each joint for detecting joint angle changes. Simulation and experimental results for closed-loop position control are also presented in the article.},

abstract = {Abstract Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are found in mobile robots, assistive wearable devices, and rehabilitative technologies. While soft actuators have been one of the most crucial elements of technology leading the development of the soft robotics field, they fall short of force output and bandwidth requirements for many tasks. In addition, other general problems remain open, including robustness, controllability, and repeatability. The SPA-pack architecture presented here aims to satisfy these standards of reliability crucial to the field of soft robotics, while also improving the basic performance capabilities of SPAs by borrowing advantages leveraged ubiquitously in biology; namely, the structured parallel arrangement of lower power actuators to form the basis of a larger and more powerful actuator module. An SPA-pack module consisting of a number of smaller SPAs will be studied using an analytical model and physical prototype. Experimental measurements show an SPA pack to generate over 112 N linear force, while the model indicates the benefit of parallel actuator grouping over a geometrically equivalent single SPA scale as an increasing function of the number of individual actuators in the group. For a module of four actuators, a 23{\%} increase in force production over a volumetrically equivalent single SPA is predicted and validated, while further gains appear possible up to 50{\%}. These findings affirm the advantage of utilizing a fascicle structure for high-performance soft robotic applications over existing monolithic SPA designs. An example of high-performance soft robotic platform will be presented to demonstrate the capability of SPA-pack modules in a complete and functional system.},

@phdthesis{sanan2013,
abstract = {Robots that can operate in human environments in a safe and robust manner would be of great benefit to society, due to their immense potential for providing assistance to humans. However, robots have seen limited application outside of the industrial setting in environments such as homes and hospitals. We believe a very important factor preventing the cross over of robotic technology from the factory to the house is the issue of safety. The safety issue is usually bypassed in the industrial setting by separation of human and robot workspaces. Such a solution is clearly infeasible for robots that provide assistance to humans. This thesis aims to develop intrinsically safe robots that are suitable for providing assistance to humans. We believe intrinsic safety is important in physical human robot interaction because unintended interactions will occur between humans and robots due to: (a) sharing of workspace, (b) hardware failure (computer crashes, actuator failures), (c) limitations on perception, and (d) limitations on cognition. When such unintended interactions are very fast (collisions), they are beyond the bandwidth limits of practical controllers and only the intrinsic safety characteristics of the system govern the interaction forces that occur. The effects of such interactions with traditional robots could range from persistent discomfort to bone fracture to even serious injuries. Therefore robots that serve in the application domain of human assistance should be able to function with a high tolerance for unintended interactions. This calls for a new design paradigm where operational safety is the primary concern and task accuracy/precision though important are secondary. In this thesis, we address this new design paradigm by developing robots that have a soft inflatable structure, i.e, inflatable robots. Inflatable robots can improve intrinsic safety characteristics by being extremely lightweight and by including surface compliance (due to the compressibility of air) as well as distributed structural compliance (due to the lower Young's modulus of the materials used) in the structure. This results in a lower effective inertia during collisions which implies a lower impact force between the inflatable robot and human. Inflatable robots can essentially be manufactured like clothes and can therefore also potentially lower the cost of robots to an extent where personal robots can be an affordable reality. In this thesis, we present a number of inflatable robot prototypes to address challenges in the area of design and control of such systems. Specific areas addressed are: structural and joint design, payload capacity, pneumatic actuation, state estimation and control: The CMU inflatable arm is used in tasks like wiping and feeding a human to successfully demonstrate the use of inflatable robots for tasks involving close physical human interaction.},

@article{greer2017,
abstract = {— We describe a new series pneumatic artificial muscle (sPAM) and its application as an actuator for a soft continuum robot. The robot consists of three sPAMs arranged radially around a tubular pneumatic backbone. Analogous to tendons, the sPAMs exert a tension force on the robot's pneu-matic backbone, causing bending that is approximately constant curvature. Unlike a traditional tendon driven continuum robot, the robot is entirely soft and contains no hard components, making it safer for human interaction. Models of both the sPAM and soft continuum robot kinematics are presented and experimentally verified. We found a mean position accuracy of 5.5 cm for predicting the end-effector position of a 42 cm long robot with the kinematic model. Finally, closed-loop control is demonstrated using an eye-in-hand visual servo control law which provides a simple interface for operation by a human. The soft continuum robot with closed-loop control was found to have a step-response rise time and settling time of less than two seconds.},

abstract = {Robotics provide an efficient approach in the development of assistive devices, due to their enhanced functionality. Sta- tistics predict that by 2035, half of the population in Germany is going to be older than fifty, every third person even over 60. These ageing societies face numerous challenges in performing simple tasks in Activities of Daily Living “ADLs”. Increasingly, a lot of research is being focused on Ambient Assisted Living “AAL” which presents a new ap- proach that promises to address the needs of elderly people. An important goal of AAL is to contribute to the quality of life of the elderly and handicapped people and help them to maintain an independent lifestyle. The introduction of ro- botics and technology-supported environments will play a huge role in allowing elderly and physically impaired people to keep living a self-determined, independent life in their familiar surroundings. In this paper, the implementation of a novel intuitive and adaptive manipulation scheme is proposed, by developing a human-machine communication inter- face between the Leap Motion controller and the 6-DOF Jaco robotic arm. An algorithm is developed to allow an opti- mum mapping between the user hand movement, tracked by the Leap Motion controller, and the Jaco arm. The system should allow for a more natural human-computer interaction and a smooth manipulation of the robotic arm, by con- stantly adapting to the user hand tremor or shake. The implementation would specially enhance the quality of living, especially for people with upper limb problems, and would support them in performing some of the essential Activities of Daily Living “ADLs”. The applications of this human-robot interaction will be discussed in relation with Ambient Assisted Living, where some use case scenarios will be introduced.},
