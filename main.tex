\begin{abstract}

This paper presents the novel design and development of a highly articulated, continuum, wearable, fabric-based Soft Poly-Limb (fSPL). This soft arm acts as an additional limb that provides the wearer with mobile manipulation assistance through the use of soft actuators made with high-strength inflatable fabrics. In this work, a set of systematic design rules is presented for the creation of highly compliant soft robotic limbs through an understanding of the fabric based component’s behavior as a function of input pressure. These design rules are generated by investigating a range of parameters through computational finite-element method (FEM) models focusing on the fSPL's articulation capabilities and payload capacity in 3D space. The theoretical motion and payload outputs of the fSPL and its components are experimentally validated as well as additional evaluations verify its capability to safely carry loads 10.1$x$ times its body weight. Finally, we demonstrate how the fully collapsible fSPL can comfortably be stored in a soft-waist belt and interact with the wearer through spatial mobility and preliminary pick-and-place control experiments.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
%\vspace{-0.75em}
% Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM) is a degenerative condition that is caused by general wear and tear or injury to the cervical region of the spinal cord, affecting limb functions and limiting independence \cite{lubelski2016}. As a result, individuals with CSM syndrome typically experience difficulty performing motor tasks, such as activities of daily living (ADLs). This population could benefit from a soft wearable collaborative robotic device, such as the fabric-based, Soft-Poly Limb (fSPL) presented in this work.

Individuals with upper-limb impairments typically experience difficulty performing motor tasks, such as activities of daily living (ADLs). These populations could benefit from a soft wearable collaborative robotic device, such as the fabric-based, Soft-Poly Limb (fSPL) presented in this work.

% (a) Illustrated concept of the fabric-based Soft Poly Limb (fSPL). (b) The prototype fSPL mounted on a lightweight waist-belt system is a soft, lightweight, wearable robot that is designed to assist users with activities of daily living (ADL). (c) Left-to-right: the limb is collapsed and stored in a pouch and then deployed to assist with tasks, such as picking up a cup.

Wearable robotics manipulators are devices that can be worn to provide an additional appendage to assist and support the user to perform tasks. These devices do not kinematically have to match the human body's anatomy, like exoskeletons \cite{gopura2011}, or prosthetic devices \cite{bogue2009}. Recent examples of different wearable collaborative robotic devices include robotic legs \cite{kurek2017,parietti2015}, arms \cite{parietti2014,saraiji2018,vatsal2017}, fingers \cite{hussain2017b,wu2015,tiziani2017}, ranging from industrial \cite{parietti2014} to medical settings and applications \cite{tiziani2017}. 

% The recent rise of wearable robotic manipulators have brought up questions of user controllability. The possibility of controlling an extra limb has been previously investigated and it is known that the human central nervous system (CNS) is found to be capable of learning to control additional limbs \cite{guterstam2011,tsakiris2010}. The controllability of robotic limbs has been explored in preliminary research, utilizing biological signals from the torso muscles \cite{parietti2017}, foot \cite{sasaki2017}, elbow \cite{wu2015}, and the forehead frontalis muscles \cite{salvietti2017}.

Wearable manipulators currently face limitations that originate from their rigid designs, like their weight, bulk, and the interaction between rigid elements and the human body \cite{delAma2012}. Soft robotics has emerged as one of the solutions to tackle the aforementioned challenges. It has introduced a variety of soft continuum manipulators made of a variety of soft actuators. The categories of soft continuum manipulators is subdivided based on the actuators that constitute them, including cable-driven \cite{mcMahan2005,calisti2011}, pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) \cite{walker2005,godage2016,yasmin2017,giannaccini2017}, elastomeric \cite{cianchetti2013,marchese2015,robertson2017,gong2018}, origami \cite{santoso2017}, and inflatable-fabric \cite{sanan2013,hawkes2017,ohta2017,best2016,liang2018,takeichi2017,kim2018,liang2017c} based manipulators.

The fusion of soft robotics and wearable manipulators has created a new category of robotics which we call, Soft Poly-Limbs (SPLs) \cite{nguyen2018}. Limited research has started to emerge in this category, Tiziani et al. \cite{tiziani2017} has introduced a soft poly-finger device, Liang et al. \cite{liang2017c} have suggested a single DOF fabric-based soft poly-arm device that would eventually be integrated as a wearable robot, but have not evaluated the device for this use case yet. Finally, we recently introduced a safe, elastomeric, SPL device \cite{nguyen2018} capable of wrapping around objects to lift approximately 2.35$x$ its own weight.

In this paper, we have designed a novel, highly-articulated, lightweight, fabric-based SPL capable of assisting users with ADL tasks (Fig. 1). We provide a material study of various fabrics tested to achieve the current design of the fabric-based SPL (fSPL). We further investigate the mechanical behavior of the fSPL and its components by using a varying set of design parameters to optimize the payload capacity of the fSPL by using computational finite element method (FEM) models that are also validated experimentally. Finally, through a series of experiments we showcase the potential of the novel fSPL to work safely around the wearer, display its high payload-to-weight ratio, and assist with ADLs.

\section{Design and Fabrication of fSPL}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:func_req}
In order to provide long-term options to users who have lost/reduced function in their hands and arms we have laid out a soft robotic architecture with functional requirements, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:spec_table}. We intend to provide the wearer with a full-length SPL that interacts safely with the user and the environment. Because of the inflatable fabric materials we intent to utilize for its structure and motion, we anticipate a lightweight (under 1$kg$) and slim arm body that can be collapsed, several times its original length, and stowed away in a pouch attached to a waist belt without adding bulkiness or impeding the user's motion. In general, an SPL should be a highly maneuverable manipulator exceeding the biological arm capabilities by offering infinite number of DOFs. This can be achieved by utilizing soft continuum designs, which could also offer configurable and compliant motions. Considering manipulation of most daily living objects, the system should also be able to carry up to approximately 1$kg$ of payload at its end-effector while being fully-extended and positioned parallel to the ground. Finally, because of its soft and continuum nature, the arm would be able to achieve whole-body grasping and manipulate even higher loads by wrapping around objects and distributing the loads.

% still i am not sure about this number...currently we do not provide explanation as to why 9dof is ideal..consider deleting the number...
%  I changed it to at least 9-DOFs


% Berm:If you think it is still necessary to to provide it then we can delete it. Because the other arm papers specify their DOFs and they are all less than what we are dealing with, so I thought it is important to mention.

% "In general, an SPL should be a highly maneuverable continuum manipulator with at least 9-DOFs, as its continuum soft structure can provide an infinite number of DOFs, while being compliant and configurable "

\subsection{Material Selection}
\label{sec:mat_select}

The applicability and functionality of fabric bending actuator arrays have been highlighted in our previous work \cite{carly2018}. There thin thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) actuators encased in nylon fabric casings are found able to withstand pressures higher than 0.3$MPa$. Instead, in this work a variety of heat-sealable TPU-coated nylon fabric materials are explored to develop soft actuators that are robust to external environmental interactions, allow for a single-step fabrication process to save manufacturing time, and are capable of withstanding even higher pressures (up to 0.53$MPa$), thus achieving higher bending and torque outputs.

A set of TPU-coated nylon fabrics with dernier values ranging from 70D to a 1000D are characterized against seal strength peel and burst tests, as seen in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. It is noted that the dernier number indicates the fiber thickness of the filament used for their fabrication.

	We perform a seal strength peel test, following the ASTM F88/F88M-15 protocol. From these tests we select the top four materials demonstrating the highest seal strength and lowest densities and further test them for the maximum pressure they could withstand when inflated (burst test), using the ASTM F2054 protocol. Based on the results, the Rockywoods 200D heat-sealable fabric (6607, Rockywoods Fabric, Loveland, CO) is chosen for its highest burst strength of 0.53$MPa$. 
%     Finally, the elastic Young's modulus for the selected material is determined using the ASTM D882 protocol and found to be 489.9$MPa$.

\subsection{Design, Fabrication and Integration}
To meet the functional requirements, the length of the fSPL is designed to match the length of an average sized adult male arm, approximately 0.59$m$ \cite{plagenhoef1983}, from the tip of the shoulder to the center of the wrist. The fSPL is subdivided into three active segments called the fabric 3 bending actuators (f3BAs), as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}d. Each segment further consists of three bending actuators arrays (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}a arranged and sewn into an equilateral triangle prism to create the f3BA segment. %, using a sewing machine (Memory Craft 6500P, Janome, Hachioji, Tokyo). 
Each bending actuator array is comprised of multiple high-strength, heat-sealed, TPU-coated nylon (200D) fabric actuators (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}c, previously selected in Section~\ref{sec:mat_select}. 
% * <polygerinos@asu.edu> 2018-09-11T23:42:18.160Z:
% 
% > , approximately 0.59$m$, from the tip of the shoulder to the center of the wrist. 
% maybe add citation?
% Berm: Added citation
% ^.

To develop the fabric actuators, the selected material is cut into a rectangular shape using a laser cutter (Glowforge Pro, Glowforge, Seattle, WA) and the pneumatic fittings are attached (5463K361, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL). A sealant is also added around the pneumatic fittings to prevent air leakage (Seam Grip, Gear Aid, Bellingham, WA). The material with the fittings are arranged on a customized CNC router (Shapeoko 3, Carbide Motion, Torrance, CA) with a soldering iron tip set at 230$^{\circ}$C and traced to seal the fabric actuators, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}b. This apparatus enables rapid heat-sealing of a variety of fabric soft actuator patterns accurately and repeatedly, up to 25 individual actuators at a time for this limb design. 

Fabric pockets to slot the individual actuators are evenly sewn into an parallel array configuration onto a strain-limited fabric layer. The individual actuators as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}c, are inserted into the pockets, creating actuator arrays. When the actuators inflate, their interaction causes the actuator array to bend or even curl completely, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fabrication}a.

% > This approach allows for ease of replacement of the actuators during maintenance. 
% you  could omit this sentence and instead briefly speak about the principle of operation of this array. how is this design producing the bending motions?
% Berm: Have added the bending motion part


% Berm:I have added a line that I cut before to replace it:
% " When the actuators on the actuator array inflate, their interaction causes the actuator array to bend or even curl completely, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}a. "

% ^.

Modular 3D-printed connectors are sewn into the distal and proximal ends of each f3BA and used to connect all the segments, creating the complete fSPL (Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}d). The modularity of the connector pieces allow for a variety of end-effectors to be mounted at the distal end of the fSPL, such as a suction cup (5427A636, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL). A zippered fabric pouch is designed to store the fSPL by collapsing its body to more than half its full length. To interface the fSPL with the human body, the fabric pouch is sewn onto a modified technical belt (S\&F Deluxe Technical Belt, Lowepro, Petaluma, CA) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}c. This 0.5$kg$ waist belt, designed to be don-doff friendly, ensures that loads carried by the fSPL can be evenly distributed along the waist of the wearer without creating pressure points. 

% The fSPL is also capable of utilizing its entire soft body to grasp and carry objects larger in size and weight, something that traditional rigid robotic arms are incapable of achieving. The pneumatic system is currently off-board and controlled by our experimental platform \cite{nguyen2018} to monitor and control the SPL.


% \section{Functional Requirements and Design of fSPL }


% In order to provide long-term options to CSM patients who have loss/reduced function in their hands and arms we have laid out a soft robotic architecture with versatile specifications, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:spec_table}. We intend to provide the wearer with a highly deployable, full-length SPL that interacts safely with the user, and can be compressed to at least half of its original length and stowed away in a small pouch attached to a waist belt, without adding bulkiness, while still being extremely light weight (under 1.0$kg$). The SPL should be a highly maneuverable continuum manipulator with 9-DOFs, while being compliant and configurable. The system should also be able to carry up to approximately 1$kg$ of payload at its end-effector position when fully-extended and parallel to the ground and carry up to twice its body weight by wrapping around the object using a whole-body grasping method, that can only be offered through such soft continuum systems. 


% In order to achieve the functional requirements, we introduce the design of a fSPL made up of three modular segments. These segments are called fabric 3-chambered bending actuators (f3CBAs).

% \subsection{Material Selection and Characterization}
% \label{sec:mat_select}




% The extremely lightweight design of the fSPL with high payload capacity, is enabled by carefully testing a set of TPU-coated nylon fabrics with dernier values ranging from 70D to a 100D, (the dernier number indicates the fiber thickness of the filament used), as seen in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. 

% We perform a seal strength peel test, following the ASTM F88/F88M-15. From these tests we select the top four materials demonstrating the highest seal strength and lowest densities %Although the seal strength for the DIY packraft 1000D material was the highest, it was deemed unviable because its incompressibility and density, which would affect the weight and retraction length of the fSPL.

% and further test them for the maximum pressure they could withstand (burst test), using ASTM F2054. Based on the results, the Rockywoods 200D heat-sealable TPU-nylon fabric (Rockywoods Fabric, Loveland, CO) is chosen for its highest burst strength of 0.53$MPa$. Finally, the elastic Young's modulus for the selected material is determined using the ASTM D882 protocol and found to be 489.9$MPa$.

% Firstly, the individual bladders need to be able to maintain a tight seal under high stresses in order to remain airtight. The TPU seal strength for each material is tested using the ASTM F88/F88M-15 standard which involves applying axial tensile stress on the seal of the TPU-coated nylon fabrics. The test for each material was conducted 3 times and the average maximum seal strength values were calculated and tabulated as seen in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. The materials with the highest seal strength were proceeded for further testing. Although the seal strength for the DIY packraft 1000D material was the highest, it was deemed unviable because its incompressibility and density, which would affect the weight and retraction length of the fSPL.  

% The chosen materials were tested for their maximum burst strength using ASTM F2054. Three tests were conducted for each material and the average maximum pressure value was recorded in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. Based on the results, the Rockywoods 200D heat-sealable TPU-nylon fabric (Rockywoods Fabric, Loveland, CO) was chosen for its highest burst strength of 0.53$MPa$.

% Finally, the elastic modulus for the selected material is determined using ASTM D882, where axial tensile stress is applied to a fabric piece with measurements of 0.26x0.00254$m$ with a rate of 25$mm/min$ until failure. The calculated Young’s Modulus of Rockywoods 200D is calculated to be 498.9 $MPa$.



% \subsection{Geometrical Parameters}



% To study the payload and bending quality of the fSPL, a set of geometrical parameters highlighted in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param} are studied. Figure \ref{fig:geom_param}a) depicts the isometric view of a single  actuator array of length $a_{l}$, consisted of $n$ number of actuators spaced at $s_{p}$. Each actuator is consisted of 4 main geometrical parameters, the fitting length ($f_{l}$), the seal length ($s_{l}$), the active width ($w_{a}$) and height ($h_{a}$). When the actuators are inflated, it is assumed to take a circular shape and therefore the active height, $h_{a}$, becomes $\frac{h_a}{\pi}$ and all the interacting actuators create a combined bending angle of $\theta_{n}$ as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}b). 

% Figure \ref{fig:geom_param}c) shows the view of the base of a single f3CBA, where three  actuator arrays are arranged in an equilateral triangle fashion. The parameters include the circumradius of the equilateral triangle($R_{c}$), the inradius of the equilateral triangle ($R_{i}$), the width of the actuator ($w_{b}$), the height of the actuator ($h_{b}$), the active width of the actuator ($w_{a}$), and the active height of the actuator ($h_{a}$).

\section{fem-based Optimization of fSPL}
An FEM modeling approach is used to predict the bending performance and tip payload force of the fSPL and its components throughout this work. It is also used to identify the geometrical parameters, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:geom_param}, that maximize the tip force of the actuator array design. In this work, we introduce the use of ABAQUS/Explicit (Simulia, Dassault Systemes) and shell elements to model inflatable thin plastic films. Because of the large-deformations and short dynamic response times observed amongst the fabric actuators, convergence of computational solutions can be only obtained through an explicit (dynamic) simulation environment.

The materials properties used in our simulations include the linear elastic modulus, determined with ASTM D882, of the TPU-coated nylon selected in Section~\ref{sec:mat_select} (Young's modulus of E = 498MPa and Poisson’s ratio of v = 0.35), the properties for the inextensible fabric layer used to hold the actuators evenly-spaced in an array  (E = 305MPa, v = 0.35), and the properties used for the PLA connector caps (E = 3600, v = 0.3). All the components of the actuators are modeled using shell explicit quadratic tetrahedral elements (C3D10M).  

Although the explicit solution is a true dynamic procedure, it has the valuable capability of solving quasi-static contact problems as well. In our case, it would be the actuator arrays inflating to contact the force plate to measure the tip payload force. Because it is impractical to simulate the event in a natural time scale as it would be computationally demanding, the explicit solution would need to be accelerated, while still maintaining its dynamic equilibrium. The first requirement is to ensure loading is as smooth as possible, so not to introduce noise. This is achieved by controlling the loading rate of the analysis at 1\% of the wave speed of the material. To verify if quasi-static conditions are achieved in the simulation, the second requirement is to inspect that the kinetic energy of the deforming  material does not exceed 5\% of the internal energy throughout the simulation. Thus, ALLKE (kinetic energy) must be just 5\% of the ALLIE (internal energy).

% ^.
To study the payload and bending capabilities of the fSPL prior to fabrication, a set of geometrical parameters, as highlighted in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}, are studied. The three main geometrical parameters studied and optimized are the active (i.e. without the seam length) width and height of the actuators ($w_{a}$ and $h_{a}$), and the number of actuators ($n$) based on their major contribution to the bending and payload capacity of the fSPL.

The active height ($h_{a}$) contributes to the bending capability, while the active width ($w_{a}$) contributes to the stability of the actuator array. If $w_{a}$ is less than $h_{a}$ then the contact surface between consecutive actuators will be smaller and therefore the actuators will lose friction resulting in torsional motions and decreased force distribution.

Therefore, $w_a$ is set to be greater than $h_a$ by a ratio $r$ that is larger or equal to at least $1.0$. The active width and height are also constrained by the diameter of the physical tube fitting $f_l$ that will be used, which is 6.2$mm$, and the heat seam width $s_l$ created by the heat sealer, which is 5$mm$. The spacing between the actuators ($s_{p}$) is limited to over $7.5mm$ because of sewing manufacturing limitations. Both the active width and height of the actuator are also constrained by $R_{c}$, which defines the cross-sectional radius of the fSPL, constrained to 50$mm$. The angle of the inflated  actuator array  $\theta_{n}$, is designed to achieve at least 180$^{\circ}$ when fully inflated. The aforementioned  physical constraints are summarized below:
\begin{align*}
R_c &= 50mm,    &  s_l &\geq 5mm,      &  \theta_n&=180^\circ,\\
f_l&=6.23mm,         &  a_l&=160mm,   &  s_p&\geq7.5mm.
\label{eq:constraints}
\end{align*}

Using the number of actuators ($n$) and the spacing ($s_{p}$), the active height ($h_{a}$) can be calculated as follows:

h_a &=  \frac{s_p \cdot \pi}{2\cdot(1-sin(\theta_n/(2\cdot n))} \label{eq:wa_sp_ha}.
\end{align}

From the circumradius ($R_c$) and inradius ($R_i$) of Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}b, we can calculate the active width ($w_a$) as:
\begin{align} 
w_a &\leq  R_c/(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} + \frac{1}{r}) - 2\cdot s_l -f_l \label{eq:wa_ha}.

% ^.

To find the geometrical parameters required to maximize the tip force of the bending actuator array, we use FEM simulations with varying parameters, the ratio ($r$) and the number of actuators ($n$). The number of actuators ($n$) is varied based on the minimum and maximum $s_p$. The maximum $n$ is determined from (2) by the minimum $s_p \geq 7.5mm$, which demonstrates that $n = 19$ is the optimum number.  The minimum $n$ is determined by the number of actuators required to generate significant tip force from the actuator array as $n = 8$. Thus from our study, more actuators in the actuator array, contributes to a larger tip force. By varying the ratio ($r$) between $w_a$ and $h_a$, from $1.0$ to $3.5$, we notice that the tip force increases with the increasing ratio until a ratio of $2.0$ is reached. After which the force decreases because the radius of the inflated actuator becomes smaller than the spacing ($s_p$) between the actuators. Therefore, the configuration that produces the highest tip force ($n = 19$) and is less likely to to present actuator slippage is selected, with ratio ($r =2.0$).

% \section{fSPL Manufacturing and Integration}


% The fabrication process of the fSPL shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication} begins with the creations of fabric TPU-coated nylon fabric actuators (6607, Rockywoods Fabric, CO). The material is cut into shape using a laser cutter (Glowforge Pro, Glowforge, Seattle, WA) and the pneumatic fittings are attached (5463K361, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL). A sealant is also added around the pneumatic fittings to prevent air leakage (Seam Grip, Gear Aid, Bellingham, WA). The material with the fittings are arranged on a customized CNC router (Shapeoko 3, Carbide Motion, Torrance, CA) with a soldering iron tip set at 232$^{\circ}$C and traced to seal the fabric bladders, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}b. This apparatus enables rapid heat-sealing of a variety of fabric soft actuator patterns of different shapes and materials accurately and repeatedly, up to 25 individual actuators at a time for this limb design. Fabric pockets for the individual actuators are then evenly sewn into an array configuration as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}a), using a sewing machine (Memory Craft 6500P, Janome, Hachioji, Tokyo). The individual actuators as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}c, are then inserted into the pockets to create an actuator array, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}a. This approach allows for ease of replacement of the actuators during maintenance. Three sets of 3 actuator arrays are then arranged and sewn into an equilateral triangle prism called the fabric 3-chambered bending actuators (f3CBAs) shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}d. Modular 3D-printed connectors are sewn into the distal and proximal ends of the f3CBAs and are used to connect each other together, creating the complete the fSPL in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}d. The modularity of the connector pieces also allows for the addition of a variety of end-effectors to be mounted at the tip of the fSPL such as a suction cup (5427A636, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL). A zippered fabric pouch is used to house the fSPL in a compressed state for ease of storage. To interface the fSPL with the human body, the fabric pouch is sewn onto a modified technical belt (S\&F Deluxe Technical Belt, Lowepro, Petaluma, CA) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}c making sure that loads carried by the fSPL can be evenly distributed along the waist of the wearer without creating pressure points and skin discomfort.

\subsection{Payload Capacity}

We have designed two experiments, repeated 3 attempts each, to investigate payload capacity of the fSPL and its components; the actuator array and f3BA. The first experiment (UTM experiment) requires to have the soft components inflate upwards against a force sensor while mounted on a universal tensile testing machine (Instron 5944, Instron Corp., High Wycombe, United Kingdom). The force output (payload) is measured at small pressure increments of 0.069$MPa$ until 0.34$MPa$ is reached. The second experiment (free-space loading experiment) requires the components to lift a set of known weights mounted at the end-effector position from a deflated state until the parallel to the ground configuration is achieved. The experiment is repeated with an increased load until this configuration can no longer be achieved. The results for both experiments are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:payload_table}.

\subsubsection{Payload capacity of the actuator array}
\label{sec:act_array_fem_real}

The FEM and experimental data comparison for the UTM experiment are seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:single_fem_real}. Both present similar payload output trends with a root mean square error (RSME) of 9.087$N$. As seen in Table~\ref{tab:payload_table}, the single actuator array is capable of producing 177.2$N$ in the FEM simulation and 174.7$\pm$6.367$N$ experimentally, demonstrating a discrepancy error of 1.4\%.

\subsubsection{Payload capacity of the f3BA}

The load capacity when the bottom two adjacent actuator arrays of the f3BA are inflated, is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:f3CAs_load_fem_real}, with an RMSE calculated at 4.05$N$ between FEM and experiment. The maximum payload for FEM simulation and experimental validation is 56.9$N$ and 53.7$\pm$1.041$N$, respectively. Investigating the payload capacity for the f3BA in the free-space loading experiment is found capable of lifting a maximum load of 5.5$kg$, approximately 15.1$x$ its own weight of 0.37$kg$.

\subsubsection{f3BA Motion Trajectory}

An experiment to compare the motion trajectory of a f3BA segment of the FEM model with this of the prototype is conducted. A set of passive reflective markers are attached to the distal end of the segment while motion capture cameras (Optitrack Prime 13W, NaturalPoint Inc., Corvallis, OR) are used to track their motion when one side of the segment is inflated to 0.345$MPa$ quasi-statically, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:f3CAs_bend_fem_real}. The end-effector position of the f3BA, in the FEM simulation and physical experiment, differ by a Euclidean distance error of 6.8$mm$. The displacement error from the initial, unpressurized f3BA segment position is 3.9\%. 

%When divided by the 17.5cm length of the f3CBA gives a displacement error of 3.9\%. %The rather close match between the trajectories of the model and experimental data shows that the FEM model could be used to predict the complex motion of a single segment of the fSPL.

\subsubsection{fSPL Motion Trajectory}
To study the FEM model's ability to predict the non-linear motion behavior produced by the fSPL, a highly complex pose of the fSPL is generated arbitrarily and recorded using the motion capture system, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pose}. Markers are added at the proximal and distal end of every segment to create virtual rigid bodies. The pose is achieved by inflating the alternating bottom actuator arrays of each segment to 0.207$MPa$ respectively in FEM. The experimental pose is achieved by inflating the same actuator sequence by 0.207$MPa$, 0.241$MPa$, and 0.172$MPa$ subsequently. There is a slight variation in the inflation of the second and third segment by $\pm$0.0345$MPa$ to compensate for the differences in FEM and reality, like manufacturing inconsistencies.The experimental Euclidean displacement error is calculated at 3.96$cm$ with FEM model estimated pose and had a 7.55\% displacement error.

\subsection{Pick-and-Place User Experiments}

To test the motion performance of the fSPL when used in real-life situations, along with user controllability, a pick-and-place experiment is performed with a number of human participants ($n$=3). For this experiment, a vacuum suction cup is used at the fSPL's end-effector. The vacuum suction cup has a theoretical payload of 0.86$kg$ and is connected to a vacuum pump with depressurization rate of 1.42x10$^{-3}m^3/s$. The experiment is set up for the user to operate the fSPL using a joystick controller previously introduced \cite{nguyen2018}, to pick a jar with peanut butter (0.3$kg$) on one end of a table and move it across and inside a target box (0.33x0.16x0.12$m$) that is placed 0.45$m$ away, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:pick_place_whole_body}. Three first-time users are timed while performing the task five times each.  %User 1 improved their time from 53.28$s$ to 24.70$s$, user 2 improved from 45.34$s$ to 20.79$s$, and user 3 improved their time from 27.69$s$ to 17$s$. 
The timed results are shown in table \ref{tab:pickplace_table} demonstrating the gradual adoption and improvement in controlling a soft, external limb. A variety of other daily livings objects are also successfully picked and placed, including a hair spray canister  (0.43$kg$) and a water bottle (0.88$kg$).

\subsection{Whole-Body Continuum Grasping}

Similar to an elephant using its trunk, the fSPL is also capable of manipulating objects by wrapping itself around them. In order to identify the effective whole-body grasping tactic, a trial and error process was used. The most efficient grasping method to carry heavier and larger objects is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pick_place_whole_body}b, where the majority of the load is supported by the proximal segment, while creating a tight wrap around the object against the body of the user that is standing upright. To demonstrate this feature, the fSPL is attached to a belt worn by a user and inflated to wrap around various objects. The objects tested include a soccer ball (0.45$kg$), a box (1.75$kg$), and a backpack (initially 1.61$kg$), as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:pick_place_whole_body}. The maximum payload capacity using this method is tested by gradually adding weights into the backpack resulting in a load of 11.13$kg$ (10.1$x$ its own body weight) before the fSPL loses support.

\subsection{Workspace}

To evaluate the effective workspace, the fSPL is mounted parallel to the ground. Two sets of reflective markers are placed at the distal and proximal ends of the fSPL to create virtual rigid bodies. The position of the markers is recorded using a motion capture system. The individual actuator arrays of the limb are inflated in various configurations using a maximum pressure of 0.34$MPa$ to cover their entire workspace. The workspace of the fSPL is generated from the collected end-effector positions shown in Fig \ref{fig:workspace_fabric_arm}. The fSPL is shown capable of reaching any point inside this workspace, resulting in an effective volume of 0.123$m$$^{3}$, with a maximum vertical range of 0.63$m$ and maximum horizontal range of 0.695$m$. This workspace provides enough vertical and horizontal range to support a user in ADL tasks in the coronal plane, based on how it is mounted. This orientation can be adjusted based on the task and user preference to optimize the effective workspace.

%When compared to an average male forearm length of 28.3$cm$ \cite{plagenhoef1983} and assuming that the rotation at the shoulder joint is fixed so that all rotation occurs through the elbow, the vertical and horizontal ranges of the fSPL are 12.5\% and 16\% larger respectively then the 0.56$m$ range of the human arm.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, the design, development, and evaluation of a novel, user-mounted, fabric Soft Poly-Limb (fSPL) was introduced utilizing high-strength inflatable fabrics. The highly-articulated, soft fSPL was designed towards supporting and assisting individuals to perform ADL. The fSPL's geometrical parameters were optimized and experimentally validated using quasi-static computational FEM models, providing design guidelines for the community to design fSPLs based on the desired payload capacity and articulation performance.

Each fSPL segment was capable of effectively lifting 15.1$x$ its own weight at 5.5$kg$ and the entire fSPL demonstrated the capacity to carry up to 1.5$kg$ of load (1.5$x$ its total weight) while able to maneuver in space. By employing the whole body grasping methodology, the fSPL was shown able to wrap around and carry loads of up to 11.13$kg$, over 10.1 times it’s own body weight. Furthermore, the fSPL demonstrated its complex motion abilities by operating when worn by users while offering a large workspace and safely interacting with the environment.

Future work will introduce the exploration of multi-mounting positions and multiple interacting fSPLs on users to expand the workspace and capabilities of controlling multi-external limbs. Further exploration of various hands-free user-intent detection methods will also be explored. Implementation of on-board actuation and power supply systems that are capable of controlling such a complicated system are being explored. Future efforts are being made to control the SPL using distributed sensing and control methods \cite{wenlong2017} with the exploration of soft-distributed and embedded sensing technologies as well.
