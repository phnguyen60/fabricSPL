\begin{abstract}

This paper presents the novel design and development of a highly articulated, continuum, wearable, fabric-based Soft Poly-Limb (fSPL) that acts as an additional limb to provide compliant and safe mobile manipulation assistance to users with upper extremity impairments. In this work, a set of systematic design rules is presented for the creation of highly compliant soft robotic limbs through an understanding of their component’s behavior as a function of input pressure. These design rules are obtained by investigating a range of geometrical parameters of the f3CBAs through computational finite-element method (FEM) models focusing on the fSPL's articulation capabilities and payload capacity in 3D space.  The motion and payload evaluation of the fSPL and its components is performed through experimental validation of the FEM models and preliminary evaluation of its capability to safely operate and interact with the user with spatial mobility tests and pick-and-place experiments while attached to a soft-waist belt that can comfortably store the fSPL when not in use.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM) is a degenerative condition that is caused by general wear and tear or injury to the cervical region of the spinal cord, affecting limb functions and limiting independence, affecting a spectrum of patients across different age groups \cite{kirby2011,lubelski2016}. CSM can cause upper limb impairment characterized by symptoms such as muscle weakness, numbness, and loss of fine motor control. As a result, individuals with CSM syndrome typically experience difficulty performing motor tasks, such as picking up a cup and other activities of daily living (ADLs). This population could benefit from a soft wearable collaborative robotic device, such as the fabric-based, Soft-Poly Limb (fSPL) presented in this work.

Wearable robotics manipulators are devices that can be worn to provide an additional appendage to assist and support the user to perform tasks. These devices do not kinematically have to match the human body's anatomy, like exoskeletons \cite{gopura2011} or prosthetic devices \cite{bogue2009}. Therefore, they do not require extra consideration in terms of alignment with biological joints. Recent examples of different wearable collaborative robotic devices include robotic legs \cite{kurek2017,parietti2015}, arms \cite{parietti2014,saraiji2018,vatsal2017}, fingers \cite{hussain2017b,wu2015,tiziani2017}, ranging from the industrial \cite{parietti2014} and medical settings \cite{tiziani2017}. 

The recent rise of wearable robotic manipulators have brought up questions of user controllability. The possibility of controlling an extra limb has been previously investigated and it is known that the human central nervous system (CNS) is found to be capable of learning to control additional limbs \cite{guterstam2011,tsakiris2010}. The controllability of robotic limbs has been explored in preliminary research, utilizing biological signals from the torso muscles \cite{parietti2017}, foot \cite{sasaki2017}, elbow \cite{wu2015}, and the forehead frontalis muscles \cite{salvietti2017}.

Wearable manipulators currently face limitations that comes with their rigid designs, like their weight, bulk, and the interaction between rigid elements and the human body \cite{delAma2012}. These challenges leads to questions related to safe interaction with the users and could possibly limit adoption of the technology. Soft robotics has emerged as one of the solutions to tackle the aforementioned challenges. The nature of intrinsically soft devices (ISDs) lead to robot designs that are lightweight, low-cost, has a high power-to-weight ratio, and is safe for human-robot interaction but are also highly adaptable and robust to the external environment \cite{polygerinos2016,laschi2016,rus2015}. This compliant nature promotes psychological acceptance of such soft wearable devices \cite{simpson2017,ding2018,sridar2017,oguntosin2015,park2014c} because they can conform to the user’s body without injuring them. The recent influx of soft robots have led to the introduction a variety of soft continuum manipulators made of a variety of soft actuators. The categories of continuum manipulators is subdivided based on the actuators that constitute them, including cable-driven \cite{mcMahan2005,calisti2011}, pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) \cite{walker2005,godage2016,yasmin2017,giannaccini2017}, elastomeric \cite{cianchetti2013,marchese2015,robertson2017,gong2018}, origami \cite{santoso2017}, and inflatable-fabric \cite{sanan2013,hawkes2017,ohta2017,best2016,liang2018,takeichi2017,kim2018,liang2017c} based manipulators. 

The fusion of soft robotics and wearable manipulators has created a new category of robotics which we call, Soft Poly-Limbs (SPLs). Limited research has started to emerge in this category, Tiziani et al. \cite{tiziani2017} has introduced a soft poly-finger device to help patients with grasping, Liang et al. \cite{liang2017c} have suggested a fabric-based soft poly-arm device, with a single degree-of-freedom, that would eventually be integrated as a wearable robot but have not evaluated the device for this use case yet, and finally we have introduced a safe, elastomeric SPL device \textbf{cite[]} with nine degree-of-freedom, and is capable of lifting weights horizontally up to 1.4 times its own body weight and wrap around objects approximately 4.07 times its own weight. 

In this paper, we have designed a novel, highly-articulated, fabric-based, upper-limb SPL capable of assisting users with ADL tasks, as seen in Fig. 1. We present the components that make up the fabric-based SPL, including: a) the novel design of the fabric-based, 3-DOF, three-chambered bending actuators (f3CBAs) and b) the complete continuum, fabric-based SPL (fSPL) created by the combination of multiple f3CBAs. We provide a material study of various fabric material tested to achieve the current design of the fabric-based SPL (fSPL). We further investigate the mechanical behavior of the limb and its components by using a varying set of design parameters to optimize the payload capacity of the fSPL by using computational finite element method (FEM) models that are also validated experimentally. We also address the possible concerns adopters would have when using such a device, in the ability to don and doff the device, its aesthetics, function, and capabilities. Finally, through experimentation we showcase the potential of the novel fSPL to work safely around a user, carry high-payload, and assisting the user with multi-tasking.

\end{table}

In order to provide long-term options to CSM patients who have loss/reduced function in their hands and arms, for their day-to-day tasks, we have looked into a soft robotic architecture with very versatile specifications summarized in Table \ref{tab:spec_table}. We intend to provide the users with a highly deployable, full-length, SPL that interacts safely with the user, and can be compressed to half of its original length and tucked away in a small pouch that can be worn on their body without providing extra bulkiness while still being extremely light weight (under 1.5kg). The SPL would be highly maneuverable with 9-DOFs, while still being continuum, compliant, and configurable. The system would be able to carry up to 1.4 times its body weight on its end-effector position and up to 4.07 times its body weight using the continuum whole-body grasping method. 

In order to achieve the design characteristics as mentioned above, we have designed a fabric-based Soft-Poly Limb made up of three modular segments called the fabric-based 3-chambered bending actuator (f3CBAs), each of which is designed with 3 arrays of bending actuators placed in an equilateral triangle fashion. Each bending actuator array is made of multiple high-strength, heat-sealed, TPU-coated nylon (200D) fabric actuators that are pneumatically controlled and stacked next to each other and sewed onto a strain limited fabric layer. When the bladders on the actuator array inflate, their interaction causes the actuator array to bend or even curl completely. The bending actuator arrays and their functionality have been highlighted in our previous work \{cite{Thalman2018}\}. Unlike our previous work, we have explored a variety of TPU-coated materials to save manufacturing time and allow a variety of stiffness wherever required. This produced an overall stiffer limb, still capable of receiving higher pressures up to 0.53$MPa$ and thus achieving high torque generation.

The length of the SPL is designed to approximately match the length of an average sized adult male arm, which is around 0.59$m$ from the tip of the shoulder to the center of the wrist. Each of the fSPL segments has a length of 0.16$m$. With the inclusion of a modular connector piece in between each segment, the SPL is approximately 0.57$m$ in length.  Customizability is also a key factor emphasized to allow for improved adoption of the fSPL in the future. The fSPL can be compressed to half its full length allowing for ease of carriage and maintenance. The fSPL is mounted on a comfortable waist belt system that weighs 0.5$kg$ that allows the integrated wearable device to don-doff easily. The segments and end-effector units are also detachable for maintenance and reconfiguring the end-effector unit for the specified task. The fSPL is also capable of utilizing its entire soft body to grasp and carry objects larger in size and weight, something that traditional rigid robotic arms are incapable of achieving. The pneumatic system is currently off-board and controlled by our Experimental Platform with all the equipment to monitor and control the SPL.

To design the fSPL with a high payload capacity yet be lightweight and robust to environmental interaction, a total of 7 TPU-coated nylon fabrics were tested as seen in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. All of the TPU-coated nylon fabrics have denier values such as 70D, 200D and 1000D which indicate the fiber thickness of threading or filament used. To determine the best performing material to be used for the fSPL fabrication, standardized testing methods for seal strength (ASTM F88), burst strength (ASTM F2054) and tensile properties (ASTM D882) were conducted.

Firstly, the individual bladders need to be able to maintain the TPU seal under high stresses in order to remain airtight. Because of this, the TPU seal strength for each material was tested using the ASTM F88/F88M-15 standard which involves applying axial tensile stress on the seal of the TPU-coated nylon fabrics. 2 pieces of the fabrics with measurements of 0.1x0.01$m$ were sealed on their 0.01$m$ edges and each tail was secured in opposite grips on the Instron machine. Tensile stress was applied at a rate of 300$mm/min$ until the specimen failed. The testing was conducted 3 times and the average maximum seal strength values were calculated and tabulated as seen in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. The materials with the highest seal strength were proceeded to further testing (Rockywoods 200D, Outdoor Oxford 200D, Seatle Diamond 200D and Ripstop 200D). Although the seal strength for the DIY Packraft 1000D is the highest, its much greater density rules it an unviable material option as it will significantly increase the weight of the fSPL.

Furthermore, the soft fabric actuators of the fSPL are required to function under high air pressures so the burst strength of the materials were tested using ASTM F2054. The nylon fabrics were sealed into 0.05x0.05$m$ pouches and air was pumped until bursting occured. The pressures in MPa which caused the pouches to burst were recorded. The test was conducted 3 times and the average air pressure value was calculated and recorded in Table \ref{tab:materialproperty_table}. Based on these results, Rockywoods 200D has the highest burst strength at 0.53$MPa$. Due to its high seal strength at 168.45N and its highest burst strength of 0.53$MPa$, Rockywoods 200D was chosen as the material for the SPL fabrication.

The Elastic Modulus for Rockywoods 200D was determined using the ASTM D882 standard, where axial tensile stress is applied to a piece of the fabric with measurements of 0.258x0.0254$m$. The Instron machine applied axial tensile stress at a rate of 25$mm/min$ until the specimen failed. The slope of the data values during the elastic deformation was determined. The test was conducted a total of 6 times to ensure the most accurate results. The Young’s Modulus of the Rockywoods 200D material is calculated to be 498.91$MPa$.


\subsection{Geometrical Parameters}

\caption{FEM analysis of number of number of actuators and ratio (r) with regards to the force generated by bladder actuator array.}
\label{fig:fem_opti}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

To study the payload and bending quality of the fSPL, a set of geometrical parameters highlighted in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param} are studied. Figure \ref{fig:geom_param}a) depicts the isometric view of a single bladder actuator array of a length $a_{l}$, consisted of $n$ number of bladders spaced at $s_{p}$. Each bladder is consisted of 4 main geometrical parameters, the fitting length ($f_{l}$), the seal length ($s_{l}$), the active width ($w_{a}$) and height ($h_{a}$). When the bladders inflate, the assumption is that it takes a circular shape and therefore the active height, $h_{a}$ becomes $\frac{h_a}{\pi}$ and the interacting bladders create a bending angle of $\theta_{n}$ as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}b). 

Figure \ref{fig:geom_param}c) shows the view of the base of a single f3CBA, where the bladder actuators in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}a) arrays are arranged in an equilateral triangle fashion. The parameters include the circumradius of the equilateral triangle fSPL ($R_{c}$), which is also the radius of the f3CBAs, the inradius of the equilateral triangle ($R_{i}$), the width of the bladder ($w_{b}$), the height of the bladder ($h_{b}$), the active width of the bladder ($w_{a}$), the active height of the bladder ($h_{a}$). 

\subsection{Optimization of Bladder Geometrical Parameters}
The three main geometrical parameters that will be studied and optimized in this study based on their major contribution to the bending and payload capacity of the fSPL are the active width and height of the bladders ($w_{a}$ and $h_{a}$), and the number of bladders ($n$).

We first determine the active width and height of the bladders based on the desired bending angle of the bending actuator array. In our previous work \{cite{thalman2018}\}, it is assumed that a single actuator takes up a circular cross-section upon inflation, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}b). The active height ($h_{a}$) of the actuator contributes to the bending and payload capacity of the bladder array. On the other hand, the active width ($w_{a}$) contributes to the stability to the bladder array. If $w_{a}$ is smaller than $h_{a}$ then the contact surface between consecutive bladders will be small and therefore the bladders will slip resulting in torsion effects and incorrect distribution of force from bladder to bladder. Therefore, the first inequality constraint is that $w_{a} \geq r \cdot h_{a}$, where $r$ is a ratio. The active width and height are also constrained by the diameter of the fitting being used, which is 6.23$mm$, and the heat seam length created by the heat sealer, which is 5$mm$. The spacing between the actuators ($s_{p}$) is limited to above 7$mm$ because of sewing manufacturing limitations. Both the active width and height of the bladder are also constrained by $R_{c}$, which also defines the cross-sectional radius of the fSPL, constrained to 50$mm$. The $\theta_{n}$, or the angle of the inflated bladder actuator array, is designed to achieve at least 180$^{\circ}$ when fully inflated. The physical constraints above mentioned are seen as follows:

\begin{align*}
R_c &= 50mm    &  s_l &\geq 5mm      &  \theta_n&=180^\circ\\
f_l&=6.23mm         &  a_l&=160mm   &  s_p&\geq7.5mm
\label{eq:constraints}
\end{align*}

Using the number of bladders ($n$), the spacing ($s_{p}$) and the active height ($h_{a}$) can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align} 
s_p &=  \frac{(a_{l} - 2\cdot(a_l/n))}{n} \\ 
h_a &=  \frac{s_p \cdot \pi}{2\cdot(1-sin(\theta_n/(2\cdot n))}
\label{eq:sp_ha}
\end{align}

From the circumradius ($R_c$) and inradius($R_i$) in Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}b), we can calculate the active width ($w_a$) as follows:
\begin{align} 
w_a &\leq  R_c/(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6} + \frac{1}{r}) - 2\cdot s_l -f_l \label{eq:wa_ha}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{FEM Optimization of the Geometrical Parameters}

\begin{figure}[b!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/single_FEM_REAL}
\caption{Payload Capability of a Single Bladder Array compared between FEM and Experimentally Validated}
\label{fig:single_fem_real}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

The optimization function is therefore is set as the tip force of the bending bladder actuator array seen in  Fig. \ref{fig:geom_param}a). This tip force is simulated using a set of FEM simulations with two varying parameters, the ratio ($r$) and the number of actuators ($n$). The ratio ($r$) was varied from $1.25$, $1.5$, $1.75$, and $2.0$. The ratio $r$ is then used to calculate $w_a$ and $h_a$ using Eq. \ref{eq:wa_ha}. The number of actuators ($n$) is varied based off the minimum and maximum spacing between the actuators ($s_p$). The maximum $n$ is determined by the minimum $s_p \geq 7mm$ as mentioned previously, which meant $n = 19$ and and $s_p = 7.5mm$ . The maximum $n$ is determined by the minimum number of actuators required to generate significant tip force from the bladder actuator array, this was determined with FEM simulations as $n = 8$, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fem_opti}. As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fem_opti}, the more the actuators aligned next to each other, the higher the tip force of the actuator array is. By varying the ratio ($r$) between $w_a$ and $h_a$, we notice fairly similar trend lines for $r = 1.75, 1.5,$ and $1.25$ and $2.0$ show larger readings with setups with $14$ actuators or more. Therefore the setup least likely to have actuator slippage that could result in torsion effects is selected, with $r =2.0$. Finally, in order to get the setup that produced the highest amount force, the maximum $n$ possible, $n = 19$, is chosen. 

\subsubsection{Experimental Validation of the Actuator Setup}

To experimentally validate the quality of the FEM model against the performance of the bladder actuator array prototype, the payload capacity of the bladder actuator array is first evaluated for payload at different set pressures. The bladder actuator array is mounted against the force plate of the universal tensile testing machine (Instron 5944, Instron Corp., High Wycombe, United Kingdom) as seen in Fig \ref{fig:payload_all}e). The bladder actuator array is inflated upwards away from the influence of gravity and the load is measured at small pressure increments until 0.34$MPa$, as seen in Fig \ref{fig:single_fem_real}. Both FEM and experimental data demonstrated similar load output trends with an RMS error of 9.087$N$. 


\section{SPL Manufacturing/Fabrication and Integration}

\label{fig:fabrication}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

The fabrication process of the fSPL shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication} starts from creating the fabric bladders using the TPU-coated nylon fabric (6607, Rockywoods Fabric, CO) selected in subsection \ref{sec:mat_select}.  The material is cut into shape using a laser cutter (Glowforge Pro, Glowforge, Seattle, WA) and the pneumatic fittings are attached (5463K361, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL). A sealant is also added around the pneumatic fitting to prevent any air leakage (Seam Grip, Gear Aid, Bellingham, WA). The material with the fittings are then arranged on the customized CNC router (Shapeoko 3, Carbide Motion, Torrance, CA) with a soldering iron tip set at 232$^{\circ}$C and traced to seal the fabric bladders, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}b). This apparatus enables rapid heat-sealing of a variety of fabric soft actuator patterns of different shapes and materials accurately and repeatedly, up to 24 individual actuators at a time. Pouches for the individual actuators are then evenly sewn into an array configuration as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}a), using a heavy duty sewing machine (Memory Craft 6500P, Janome, Hachioji, Tokyo). The individual actuators as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}c), are then slotted into the pouches in the actuator array, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}a). This approach of using individual actuators in pouches allows for ease of replacement of the actuators in the event of maintenance. Three sets of 3 actuator arrays are then arranged and sewn in an equilateral triangle fashion, with internal angles of 60$^{\circ}$, to create equilateral triangle prisms called the fabric 3-chambered bending actuators (f3CBAs) shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}d). The 3 sets of f3CBAs are connected together using 3D printed modular connectors fabricated using PLA material (1811201, MakerGear, Beachwood, Ohio). The actuator arrays are sewn and glued onto the connector pieces using kevlar threads (8800K41, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL) on both ends. The f3CBAs segments are bolted at the connector pieces to create the fSPL as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fabrication}d). The modularity of the connector pieces also allows for the addition of a variety of end-effectors to be mounted at the tip of the fSPL such as a suction cup (5427A636, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL).

Finding the appropriate mounting point for the fSPL on the human body is essential for multiple factors such as force transmission, comfort, and safety. Keeping in consideration, the functional requirement to carry up to four times its weight, its support requires to be strong enough to hold its position. To tackle these issues the hip was used as the main attachment point for the fSPL. Mounting the fSPL at the hip also allows for free manipulation of the arm through a workspace that complements the user's arms. To attach the fSPL to the body, a modified technical belt(S\&F Deluxe Technical Belt, Lowepro, Petaluma, CA) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}c) is used and the modifications are focused on increasing the belt's resistance to force. The utility belt includes reinforcement necessary to distribute the forces generated by carrying weights ranging from 0.1$kg$ to 1$kg$. A zippered fabric pouch used to house the fSPL in a compressed state for ease of storage. A support structure consisting of a 3D printed “L” bracket is designed to mount the fSPL to the belt. A thermoplastic acrylic-polyvinyl chloride (TAPC) sheet manufactured to fit the curvature of the torso is used as a padding structure to evenly distribute the forces onto the body to avoid pinch points and discomfort.

\section{Testing and Evaluation of fSPl}
For the fSPL to be effective in everyday use, it is vital that the fSPL is capable of carrying the desired payload and maneuver effectively in 3D space. Therefore, we evaluated the fSPL through experimentally validating the computational FEM models of the system, performing various payload experiments, determining the maneuverable workspace of the SPL, and finally determining the users' ability control and carry a variety of daily livings objects through pick-and-place experiments.

\subsection{FEM vs Experimental}

%Why are there two FEM vs Experimental sections here?
\subsubsection{f3CBA FEM vs Experimental}

\begin{figure}[b!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/3CA_instron}
\caption{Payload Capability of a f3CBA unit compared between FEM and Experimentally Validated}
\label{fig:f3CAs_load_fem_real}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

A single f3CBA segment is also mounted against the UTM as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:payload_all}a). This was done to compare the load capacity when inflating 2 adjacent bladder actuator arrays against the FEM model of the same set up. The two sides of the f3CBA were also inflated until 0.34$MPA$, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:f3CAs_load_fem_real}. Both the experimental and FEM simulation data when compared showed close approximation with an RMS error of 4.057$N$. 

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.43\textwidth]{Figures/3CA_bend_FEM_REAL_v2}
\caption{Bending Capability of a f3CBA unit compared between FEM and Experimentally Validated}
\label{fig:f3CAs_bend_fem_real}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}


An experiment to compare the bending motion trajectory of a f3CBA segment of the FEM model and prototype was also conducted. A set of passive reflective markers are attached to the distal end of the segment to create a rigid body in the center of the distal enter and the motion capture system is used to track the motion of the distal end when one side of the segment is inflated up to 0.345$MPa$ quasi-statically, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:f3CAs_bend_fem_real}. The distal end position of the 3CA in the FEM simulation and experimental results in a Euclidean distance error of 6.8$mm$. The rather close match between the trajectories of the model and experimental data shows that the FEM model can be used to predict the complex motion of a single segment of the fSPL.

\subsubsection{fSPL FEM vs Experimental}

To investigate the payload capacity of the complete 3-segment, fSPL using the prediction of the FEM model and the experimental validation through the fSPL prototype, the fSPL was inflated away from gravity and the end-effector of the fSPL was pushed against the UTM load plate as seen in Fig \ref{fig:payload_all}c). The maximum load detected from the instron force plate was 1.5$kg$ where the bottom adjacent chambers of the distal segments were pressurized up to 0.345$MPa$ and the proximal segment’s bottom adjacent chambers were pressurized up to 0.207$MPa$ to maintain the fSPL parallel the ground against gravity. Both FEM and experimental data demonstrated similar load output trends with an RMS error of 9.087$N$. 

Finally, we determine the FEM’s model to predict the continuum complex non-linear motion produced by the entire fSPL, a single complex pose is generated and recorded using the motion capture system. Four sets of markers were added at the proximal and distal end of every segment to create virtual rigid bodies along the body of the fSPL. The fSPL was mounted horizontally against gravity, and the bottom two chambers of the first segment were inflated to 0.207$MPa$ and 0.345$MPa$ respectively, the bottom right chamber of the second segment was inflated to 0.207$kPa$, and finally the bottom left chamber of the third segment was inflated to 0.207$MPa$ to generate a snake-like motion using the fSPL, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:pose}. The experimental Euclidean displacement error is found to be \textbf{xxx} $mm$ when comparing the FEM model. Thus proving that the FEM models created for the single bladder actuator array, the f3CBA, and the full fSPL are able to predict the load capability and complex motions generated by the interacting bladder actuator arrays.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Payload Capacity of the fSPL}


\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/payload_all_v2}
\caption{Payload Setup for single bladder array, f3CBA, and fSPL}
\label{fig:payload_all}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Single Bladder Actuator Array Payload}
The upward force generated by a single actuator array is tested using the Instron machine. The last actuator on the array is placed directly under the Instron machine and the air pressure inside the bladders were increased in increments of 0.069$MPa$ until 0.345MPa. In the end, the single bladder array produced 174.73$N$ of force at 0.345$MPa$, which is similar to lifting 17.4$kg$ of weights by only a single array of bladders.

\subsubsection{Single Segment f3CBA Payload}

A single arm segment was fixed horizontally and weights were then attached on the free end of the arm in increments. The bladders on the arm were then inflated until the arm segment was at least parallel with the ground. The first test was conducted by inflating only 1 side of bladders which managed to lift up 4.8$kg$ at 0.35$MPa$. Next, 2 sides were inflated which managed to lift up 6.3$kg$ at 0.372$MPa$. With the single segment weighing in at about 0.37$kg$, and able to lift up to 6.3$kg$, this means that it can carry approximately 17 times its own weight. The segment was then fixed horizontally and this time the free end was placed directly under the Instron machine. Only 1 side of bladders were inflated, which applies normal force onto the Instron machine. The air pressure was increased in increments of 0.069$MPa$ until 0.345$MPa$ and the respective force values were recorded. The test was conducted 3 times to ensure the most accurate results. At 0.345$MPa$, the segment, with only 1 side inflated produced 40.2$N$, which is equivalent to 4.02$kg$ of weight. The same procedures were repeated for when 2 sides were inflated and the segment generated 53.7$N$ at 0.345$MPa$, which is equivalent to 5.37$kg$. These results for 1 and 2 sides are very similar to the real payload test with discrepancies of only 16.7\% and 14.8\% respectively. This has shown that the single segment (f3CBA), which is able to generate 53.7$N$ of force while only weighing at 0.37$kg$ has an impressive payload-to-weight ratio of 14:1.

\subsubsection{fSPL Payload}
The arm is fixed parallel to the ground and weights were attached on the free end. The air pressure inside the bladders were increased until the arm is able to lift up the weights. The maximum payload capacity of the full arm (fSPL) is 1.5$kg$ when the first and second segment are at 0.345$MPa$ and the third segment is at 0.207$MPa$. The full arm weighs approximately 1.11$kg$, and is able to lift weights of up to 1.5$kg$.Next, the full arm was fixed horizontally and its free end was placed under the Instron machine. Air pressure in the bladders for each segment was increased gradually until all of the segments were at 0.345$MPa$, which generated a maximum force of 15.56$N$. This is comparable to lifting weights of almost 1.5$kg$ and these results show that the fSPL can carry items 1.36 times its own weight.

\subsection{Pick and Place}



\begin{figure}[b!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/pick_place_whole_body}
\caption{The different methods the fSPL can carry payload, either using its end-effector or whole body to wrap around objects.}
\label{fig:pick_place_whole_body}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

To test the combination of effective fSPL payload, or the payload when the fSPL is used in real-life situations, along with user controllability, a pick-and-place experimental setup designed for multiple users was designed. For this test, a vacuum suction cup manipulator is connected to the end of the fSPL. The vacuum suction cup has a theoretical payload of 0.86$kg$ and is connected to a vacuum pump with depressurization rates at 1.42x10$^{-3}m^3/s$. The experiment is set up for the user to operate the fSPL using the joystick controller to grab a jar of peanut butter (0.1$kg$) on end of the table and move it across the table where a target box (0.33x0.16x0.12$m$) is placed 0.45$m$ away from the jar, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:pick_place_whole_body}. Three users are timed to get the jar from one end of the table into the box. Each user had 5 timed trials. User 1 improved their time from 53.28$s$ to 24.70$s$, user 2 improved from 45.34$s$ to 20.79$s$, and finally user 3 improved their time from 27.69$s$ to 17$s$. Thus proving the gradual improvement of adoption of using and controlling a soft, external limb. A variety of other daily livings objects were also successfully picked and placed, including a hair spray can (0.43$kg$) and a water bottle 0.88$kg$.


% \subsubsection{Fold and Unfold}
% Our preliminary designs show that such compliant segment is able to linearly collapse two times its own length when squeezed, but also linearly deploy and perform multi-degree-of-freedom bending motions when pressurized (Figure 14).

% times its length and bend in multi-DoF when deployed and ressurized.}
% \label{fig:unfold_fold}
% \vspace{-1.5em}
% \end{figure}


\subsection{Whole-Body Continuum Grasping}


The fSPL is capable of grasping objects by wrapping itself around the objects, similar to how an elephant can grasp objects with its trunk. This method of grasping allows the fSPL to carry heavier objects than it can support at the end of the arm. The fSPL was attached to a belt worn by a user and the arm was inflated to wrap around various objects to demonstrate its whole body grasping capabilities. The user would place the object within the fSPL's reach,then the fSPL would wrap around the object to hold it in place, and the user would release the object and show that the fSPL was capable of holding the object without any other assistance. The objects held in this way were a soccer ball weighing 0.45$kg$, a full plastic storage box weighing 1.75$kg$, and a weighted backpack, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:pick_place_whole_body}. The maximum full body carrying weight of the fSPL was tested by adding weights to the backpack until the fSPL was no longer capble of supporting the backpack. The maximum weight that the fSPL could support in this manner was 4.51$kg$.


\subsection{Workspace}
\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/Workspace_Fabric_ARM}
\caption{The different methods the fSPL can carry payload, either using its end-effector or whole body to wrap around objects.}
\label{fig:workspace_fabric_arm}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\end{figure}

The workspace of the fSPL was determined by recording the 3d coordinates of points on the outside of the workspace. The fSPL was mounted on a testing platform such that the fSPL was parallel to the floor when linearly extended, and reflective markers were placed on the base and tip of the fSPL to mark its starting and ending locations. Individual chambers of the arm were inflated to pressures up to 0.345$MPa$ to produce orientations at the maximum range of the fSPL. The pressures were provided by the testing rig which was equipped with a set of 16 regulators ((ITV1050-21N2CL4 Pressure Regulators
SMC) and 32 solenoid valves (MHE3-MS1H-3/2G-1/8-
K, Festo, Esslingen, DE). The regulators and solenoids were driven with a real time controller (CompactRIO, National Instruments Inc., Austin, TX). The position of the markers was recorded using a motion capture system with six cameras (Optitrack Prime 13W, NaturalPoint Inc., Corvallis, OR) surrounding the fSPL to produce a set of three dimensional points at the edge of the fSPL's workspace. A dome, shown in Fig \ref{fig:workspace_fabric_arm} was created from the set of points collected by the motion tracking system to represent the far reaches of the fSPL's workspace. It was assumed that the fSPL could reach any point inside that maximum dome, therefore the volume of the dome would be equal to the volume of the workspace. The fSPL has a workspace volume of 0.22m$^{3}$, a maximum vertical range of 0.63$m$ and a maximum horizontal range of 0.65$m$.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, the design, development, and evaluation of a novel, user-mounted, fabric Soft Poly-Limb (fSPL) is introduced. The highly-articulated, soft fSPL is designed towards supporting and assisting impaired individuals, for example CSM patients, with daily living tasks. The fSPL’s geometrical parameters are initially optimized and experimentally validated using quasi-static computational FEM models providing design guidelines for the community to design an fSPL based on the desired payload against gravity and bending ability.

We demonstrated that this successful implementation of the fSPL can carry up to 1.5$kg$ while still being able to maneuver in space with various pick-and-place experiments, meeting the requirements of dealing with daily objects and tasks. Each fSPL segment, the f3CBA, is able to effectively lift 6.3$kg$, up to its 17 times its own weight without any effects of torsion noticed. By employing the whole body grasping strategy, the fSPL can wrap and carry load of up to 4.5$kg$, up to 4 times it’s own body weight of 1.11$kg$.

The fSPL was shown to be capable of safely working around a user with a large workspace and be able to safely interact with the environment. The fSPL’s segmented modular design allows the rapid swapping of actuators from the bladder array pouches for maintenance as well as interchangeable and replaceable segments. The end-effector of the fSPL is also modifiable to different types of graspers aside from the suction cup.

Future work will introduce the exploration of multi-mounting positions and multi-interacting fSPLs on one user to expand the user’s workspace and capabilities of controlling multi-external limbs. In this work, the fSPL was controlled using a joystick module but various user-detection methods have been tested in our previous work, as well was sEMG for a hands-free method of controlling the limb \cite{Nguyen2018}. Further efforts are being made to improve and explore other hands-free, user-intent detection for external robotic limbs.

Another limitation of the fSPL is the tethering of the system. We plan to look at decentralized and distributed on-board actuation and power supply systems that are capable of controlling such a complicated system. Future efforts are being made to control the SPL using distributed sensing and control methods \cite{Wenlong2018} with the exploration of soft-distributed and embedded sensing technologies as well. 

In total, we believe that this work provides the readers with the capability of designing highly lightweight and soft robotic limbs capable of being easily stored and deployed on-site capable of support the versatile amount of activities of daily living.
